Yes, there are a couple of these even cheaper, but sometimes you do get what you pay for. This is a hefty little box for the size and it feels quite solid and well made. While I agree with a couple comments regarding the location of the power plug, it was not a deal killer for me at all. It sits back behind everything and is in no way an eyesore among my TV and game gear. I have it connected to an XBox, my DVR, a Sony BluRay player and have one port still available if I ever decide to connect my TV. I ran an ethernet cable from the modem/router in my media room into the family room via the attic, and once connected, all components worked immediately with no issues at all. We ended up using the extra port for a few days while we were having problems with our wireless network before the replacement router arrived, and the connections on the notebooks were excellent as well.

"[3, 3]",1175126400,A29EGA8RIDPUJ1,"This is a nice, compact 5-port plug-and-play switch that definitely improved the speed of my local PC network.  I read a review where this switch runs hot.  I have all five ports in use and its running around 99F degrees.  My DSL modem with just two ports in use actually runs hotter (101F).  Okay, four degrees but you can tell a difference when you touch them.  The FS105 switch does not interfere with AM radio reception as my old Linksys 5 port hub especially at the upper AM radio band.  Perhaps it is the metal box of the FS105 that provides better shielding.  Its nice that Netgear gives me the screws and wall anchors for mounting the switch to something either wood or plaster.  But is it too much to ask Netgear to include a mounting template (piece of paper) so I can put those screws exactly where I need them with less fuss than measuring and guessing?Perhaps I should not be disappointed that the FS105 I got is not the same one as pictured on the Amazon page.  That picture shows an uplink button and the unit is wider.  I connected a cable from my DSL modem/router's uplink port to the first port of this switch and it works just fine.If you only need four to five ports, this is a very nice non-managed switch.  And did you know that according to Netgear, the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) is twice that of either the FS108 (8-port version) or the FS116 (16-port version).  It may make more sense to buy two of these switches from a reliability sense.","03 29, 2007",4.0,B00002EQCW,Definitely improves performance for a small LAN,D. Henderson

They're very handy to park on conference tables and desks to provide wired internet connections for multiple people.  It's a very solidly built model (all metal), with a no-frills industrial design and small footprint.  Installation is a snap -- just plug in the power supply, connect your PCs/peripherals with regular patch cables, and your done.Two issues:1) This is not a gigabit switch, just an old-fashioned 10/100 switch.  If you're just using it for internet connections, that's probably fine, since you'll be limited by your internet speed anyway.  But if you're running a gigabit ethernet and want to move gigs over the network quickly, you'll need a faster switch (assuming all the other gear on your network is also gigabit speed).2) I have had a couple of this switches fail over the years, and it's always been the power supply that failed, not the switch.  Given how cheap these are now, I'd suggest that you buy a spare, just to have the spare power supply on hand, if you can't afford to have a network failure for more than a few minutes.  If the power supply fails, you can plug in a new power supply in under a minute, which is easier than replacing a whole switch.

(The &quot;vistajack&quot; feature.)- Right-angled barrel power connector which reduce the likelihood of disconnecting power accidentally.- An easy-to-access switch to toggle port 1 between station mode and uplink mode.  Unlike some hubs where two jacks are wired together, this design prevents accidentally shorting a station to an uplink.- Screw-mount notches on the underside allows for easy attachment to the wall, underside of a counter, etc.With a 1000-MAC address buffer and 200 Kbytes-per-port packet buffer, this switch can easily handle the typical traffic load of small- and medium-sized networks.The Netgear product is not the cheapest 10/100-switch (check out the D-Link Fast Ethernet Switch, for example), but for overall design and value-for-money, I still like the Netgear the most.","01 24, 2001",5.0,B00002EQCW,"A good, solid switch.

Final verdict, I will consider getting another one to replace this but only if I can't find one with a better warranty plan for about the same price.See original review below...There isn't really much to say about a switch, it has one simple job and as long as it does it that's what counts (A switch for those who are not certain is easiest to explain by saying it is akin to a power strip, you can plug all the machines you want into to it, but if you don't plug it into a managed source of signal such as a router or server it is like expecting a surge strip to provide power and work when it is not plugged into an AC outlet). If you want to split one LAN Drop (Network plug in) at for example at your entertainment center and hook up your PS3, Cable/Satellite box, Internet ready TV, A/V receiver with internet radio, etc. This is for you because all a switch does is take the one IP address assigned to it by the host system and share it out over all devices connected to it (while they are turned on and seeking connection of course, it doesn't allot bandwidth to devices that are not currently asking for any).Bottom line is this does the job so far and is well constructed, at this very moment unit has been plugged in for almost two weeks and is cool to the touch (I have it wall mounted behind my TV were it gets plenty of airflow) so time will tell but I have seen units like this in multiple brands at customer sites (I'm a network tech) work for years, if this one fails in an abnormally short time I will revise my review to reflect the time and details/circumstances of the failure.","07 21, 2010",2.0,B00002EQCW,*Updated* So far so good... not anymore,M.

"[1, 1]",1260748800,AV5UHOOAXF5FN,"So far, I am impressed with this switch.  The small footprint and the ease of installation is really something to behold.  It has been reliable as well, as a small, unmanaged switch should be.I debated on whether to get a gigabit switch or a fast ethernet (100Mbps) switch.  I decided to be cheap and went for this little switch.  I also have an old 10Mbit ethernet switch by Netgear; that only had four sockets, and one had to be designated for uplink.  That little switch was the part of a reason for taking the Netgear, though; it was small, and it was reliable.  In that regard, the switch did not disappoint.What did disappoint me was, though, the fact that file transfers between two peer computers (i.e. not to the Internet) took longer than expected.  The peak transfer rate could not go beyond 10MB/s; that is expected, and totally fine for my DSL (and for streaming from one computer to another, to an extent) but I found it to be sluggish, as the transfer rate I had from an external USB to hard drive could go for 30MB/s or higher.I gave full marks due to the fact that it was a great switch for its class.  The problem is, though, that the class itself is showing signs of age.  For those of you who would like to set up a home server, I recommend you make a jump to the realm of gigabit ethernet.","12 14, 2009",5.0,B00002EQCW,"Good, but aging",N

I have one in my closet, one behind the television. and one behind the wall in the back room.  I also carry one around in my computer bag just in case.  Netgear makes good hardware.  I would buy again in a heartbeat if I needed another.","08 21, 2013",4.0,B00002EQCW,Great switch.,"William Marquez ""MannyW"""

No software to install and no setting to choose.Only one thing potential buyers needs to be aware:  there are only 4 ports available for downstream connection.  You need use one to connect to your router, modem, or whatever gives you internet access.","02 27, 2014",5.0,B00002EQCW,Easy to setup and runs great,"X. Gong ""Pea"""
"[1, 2]",1262736000,AGOPJZFEL0Q1E,"This network switch works fine.  What more can you say?Some of the reasons I selected this unit include the metal housing (which makes the unit a little heavier and less likely to slip around) and the co-location of the status LEDs with the jacks.Be sure to check the dates on other reviews as some of them are just plain wrong.  For example, this most recent version/model does NOT have an ""Uplink"" selector switch...the ports configure automatically if you need to uplink to another switch or router.  Also, the power connector is NOT a right-angle connector on this unit.One last note...this unit uses a 7.5 VDC power supply, so it will not work with all those older 12 VDC Netgear power supplies you have lying around.","01 6, 2010",5.0,B00002EQCW,Be sure to check the date of the review....,"Zube ""kile25"""
