I bought this to route security cameras out to the internet but there was no apparent way to reserve specific IP addresses with this unit.  There was also no way to set that up in the camera system's firmware.  With Tomato installed, I was able to permanently assign static internal IP addresses by linking the mac addresses.  I was also able to  turn down the wifi power which helps keep the neighbors from prying.Anyway, this is a solid run of the mill router.",5.0,Durable Workhorse,1405296000,"07 14, 2014"

The main reason I got this router was to use it for Bit Torrent, and it excels in that regard. Other routers I had would start dropping packets or ignoring page requests when I had 5 or 6 torrents seeding.

I decided to go with this one especially due to the price and the decent reviews on Amazon. I have one PC and 2 Mac Laptops.First of all the factory software CD provided by the manufacture is completely worthless. After several unsuccessful attempts I finally called the customer support in order to install the software. Once up and running, it works decent, except for the dropping the Mac laptops out of the coverage several times, so I had to go to the airport section of Mac, find the router and click on it, etc.I think after all I should have gone with the dual band Netgear router. It is listed on Amazon for about $150 but is worth each Penny.A follow up on this router.After owning it for abour 6 months, it has been rather a pain. Very frequently it just stopped working and then I have to unplugg it from the electricity jack and back on. I did the mistake and pushed on the buttom ""Reset"" on the back of the router, then I realized that all the setting will be erazed and I ha dto rest the router name, pass word, etc. I am not very happy with this product and would not recommend it.",1.0,Need more than simple skills!!

Connect your Internet modem to the router's Internet plug.2. Use the included blue cable to connect your computer's network plug to one of the numbered plugs on the router.3. Connect the modem to power (or turn it off, then on again), then connect the router to power, then wait a minute for things to start up.You can stop here if you don't care about wireless security (you now have an unsecured Wi-Fi network called 'linksys'). But if you do want security on your Wi-Fi network (you should!), keep going...4. Start the web browser on your computer and go to the address 192.168.1.15. Enter 'admin' for both the user name and the password.6. You'll now be at the router's setup web pages. Click 'Wireless' (to the right of 'Setup').7. Change the wireless network name to anything you want (something unique and recognizable is best).8. Click Save Settings. Once they're saved, click on Wireless security.9. Set security mode to WPA2 Personal, set WPA algorithm to TKIP+AES, and enter anything you want for WPA shared key (this is the wireless network password; for maximum security use a meaningless jumble of letters and numbers, but whatever you pick, remember it!)10. Click Save Settings.11. If you only need wireless, you can now unplug the cable between the computer and the router.Now you should have a Wi-Fi network with the name you gave it in step 7, and the password is what you entered in step 9.

I bought this for emergency backup because all home routers eventually fade away from old age, since they do not come with fans or decent heat sinking. I have two set up in the house, one on first floor and another on 2nd floor on opposite side of house. Together, there are no dead spots in the house.

A35RJ50ZCWEONY,B000BTL0OA,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I had a WRT150N that was going on the fritz (owned it for several years but was requiring frequent hard resets to obtain functionality).  While shopping for a new wireless router I looked at a lot of N-band routers but they either didn't have external antennas (for when I buy a house) or they were some off brand that I couldn't trust.  Then, I decided that I didn't really need 100+ Mbps - my internet connection speed never tops 15 Mbps, so 54 Mbps is enough for my laptop, my Roku and my Xbox no problem.  I don't use wireless to do many network transfers (laptop &lt;-> desktop) and even when I do, the limiting factor was never wireless speed, but hard drive r/w speeds, so I decided I'd buy the industry standard in wireless routers - the WRT54GL.  This is, and has been, a rock solid piece of equipment - just look at NewEgg.com - it has thousands of reviews praising it for performance, longevity, expandability, etc...My only disappointment with this router, was that after I had it set up so that the Xbox didn't have any NAT issues with Xbox Live and after I had the Roku connecting and streaming to it, it deleted all my setup.  It happened the same day the cable company remote reset our cable modem - the router returned to factory default settings.  That was a pain - especially to get the Roku working again.Still, this router has been stable, performing like a workhorse since I bought it and the dozens of people I've recommended buy this (literally, dozens) that have, have enjoyed a stable, simple wireless setup.

A3OO79O92GRKI2,B000BTL0OA,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I'll just start with the most obvious Con to get it out of the way: This isn't an 'n' class router, so 54Mbps is all you get with just one wireless user. Simultaneous users cut that down further, so if you want the fastest router out there, skip this dated technology.Now the good: If you want one of the least expensive and versatile routers available, the WRT54GL will not disappoint. While the stock firmware is acceptable for doing some pretty good stuff, putting DD-WRT onto it makes this puppy an incredibly featured router.I have been using this router off and on for about 5 years, always trying to find something that works better, but always going back to this one in the end.I have used this router in both bridged and non-bridged mode, as an open-access point, and more recently, as a repeater. In fact, it works so well as a wifi client and repeater that my throughput has doubled at the direct ethernet connected desktop vs. using the n-wireless adapter it had plugged into it previously. So don't discount the 'g'!!! And of course everything else at the repeater end of the house now has a nice strong repeated signal as well.Signal strength with it's short antennas is pretty average, but larger antennas would likely help that and are available in plenty of places. And in the 5 years of use, I have never seen this router crash. I can't say that for the other 4 wireless routers I have tried along the way!In a nutshell, this router is a workhorse with solid, if not top-speed performance, and superb reliability, with routing and filtering options (using DD-WRT) that I have barely begun to explore. So if you are tired of buggy routers that seem to crash at the worst times, the WRT54GL just might put those headaches to rest permanently.",4.0,Maximum Versatility in an Inexpensive Box,1383177600,"10 31, 2013"

The original was flashed with DD-WRT v23 and it has been up and running without fail for over a year and a half (just upgraded it to v24 with no problems). Even if you're not into changing the firmware don't bother with the included software as it's garbage.  Instead, hook your computer up with the included lan cable, type 192.168.1.1 and configure the router appropriately.As other reviewers have stated DD-WRT and other third party firmware add greater functionality to the router and are highly recommended. Do a google search ""for how to flash the wrtgl with dd-wrt firmware"" and you'll find a great visual guide for flashing the router at M&L; Adventures. IMPORTANT - make sure you use the micro or mini version of DD-WRT the first time you flash it as the latest linksys firmware does not allow flashes over 3MB.  Once you've flashed the router with the mini DD-WRT then you can apply the regular flash DD-WRT v24(5/24/08) std.  If you apply the standard without first applying the micro/mini you'll brick the router (I did it twice before figuring out the sequence). You can recover the router but it's a pain.

A2L73KNIMIF3TY,B000BTL0OA,AP,"[3, 3]","I have used this device for years and I have installed it for many of my friends. Recently I decided to upgrade it to the latest Linksys EA3500 / N750 which I have using for about 1 full month and finally after at least 2 phone calls with Linksys Tech Support, hours trying to make it work the way I wanted it, it went back to Amazon, and instead I purchase the Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL.If you want to know why I returned the Linksys EA3500 / N750 please my review: Linksys EA3500 / N750.Besides the N speed, really the Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL is still a lot cheaper, and a more flexible and the best, it doesn&#8217;t require Cisco to know what your username and password are (yes, if you  buy the Linksys EA3500 / N750 or any of the new ones, you must create an account with Cisco and provide them with your router&#8217;s username and password).Among other reasons and as a parent, keeping my kids Internet browsing habits under control is important and the Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL has every feature I may need whereas the Linksys EA3500 / N750 doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not sure why Linksys/Cisco trimmed so severely parental controls from the Linksys EA3500 / N750, considering these are SOHO devices. This in summary the parental control differences between the two:WRT54GL (Old):1. 10 Internet Policy Access2. Ability to enable and disable each one of them3. You can add or remove PCs to each one of these policies, maximum flexibility.4. Option to configure every day or specific days per policy.5. Option to configure times per policy.6. Option to block services: DNS, ping, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, POP3, IMAP, etc. per policy!7. Option to define non-standard ports, per policy.8. Web site blocking by URL per policy9. Web site blocking by keyword per policy.EA3500 (this new Linksys device):1. 1 list of target devices (you can add or remove).2. Time: You can choose the time of the day these computers will have or not access to internet.3. Block specific sites: You can add a list of URLs you want to block.But anyway, I received the new Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL, and it is working flawlessly as always. In fact I have a network at home of 3 of them, all broadcasting the same SSID so my devices can connect automatically to the closest one. If you are interested in creating the same type of network, feel free to drop me a line.I have seen some reviews of customers complaining that is difficult to configure. That cannot be more wrong. Below is the standard configuration using WPA2 Personal.

[...]Next is wkipedia which will summarize the above, but if you do not have the finer detail knowledge of the above article, then this summary will be less value... [...]The important point when thinking about buying this product which seems to be a coin toss as far as reliability is to consider the fact out of the box everyone has DIFFERENT hardware versions as well as software versions, the confusing nature is that these TWO different aspects are both referred to as FIRMWARE.Quick note there are now 7 different ""hardware"" versions for the ""G"" model. ""GL"" version came out after G version 5 so as to continue Linux support, ""GL"" vesion has 2 version, ""GL"" has more memory. I have ""G"" version 6, and have no issues, I did not even bother preloading the software. I jave no idea what is on it, just do not like junking up the PC with needless stuff, as you have full access via web browser anyways, anyone that has tinkered with any router knows how to configure. I do admit there are ALOT of features with stock ""software"".Anyways, I feel for those that have issues, I know of someone that also has quirks. But just FYI, compare apples to apples, version 6 works just fine for me, I have a wireless Powerbook G4, wired PC, wired Epson print server printer. No drop connections, and full broadband speed.Lastly, again a quick summerization, for those wondering about the GL model, here is the deal, the WRT54G is the original model, it WAS originaly Linux base, but eventually Linksys stopped and changed that with version 5 to VxWorks (propritary). Linksys also at that time designated the GL model to continue with the Linux fans. The bottom line is both G and GL version can be flashed to any thrid party to become a super freak router. One difference between the two is that the GL version DOES have increased MEMORY.",5.0,What version do you have?,1167868800,"01 4, 2007"

I would have to go upstairs, unplug it for 1 minute, and then let it reboot and broadcast again.

It's very user friendly and easy to set things up. Linksys knows that not everyone out there is good at wireless networking or networking in general.

The GL is the same router as the original WRT54G.  Linksys has since cheapened the WRT54G series, using less RAM, slower procs, and worst of all, VXWorks instead of a real Linux OS.Over the years I've ran various 3rd party firmware on them.  That's of course why you buy this model!  DD-WRT is for those who want ALL of the features possible.

Stable, clean interface, and it can handle a decent amount of traffic without bogging down.Some 12 years later, these routers are starting to show their age.  No 5GHz support, no USB support out-of-the-box (although some people have soldered USB ports onto them), slower procs, only 802.11G and not 802.11N or 802.11AC.  That said, I still have quite a few of them out in the field for both business & home use.  I even bought one this year to replace one which took a nasty lightning strike.I mostly use these as pure routers and shut off their WiFi APs, preferring to deploy Ubiquiti's UniFi and AirMAX wireless access points which run 802.11G, N, and AC.

Well, I want to also pass on a warning about the WRT120N and say why I ended up replacing it with a WRT54L.The WRT120N is a 802.11n router billed as being backwards with 802.11g but it is not!! It is very unreliable and after finding myself needing to constantly do a power off/on reset due to it sporadically ""locking"" up I decided it was high time to give it the boot after a few weeks of that nonsense and go back to a WRT54 series wireless router.The WRT54L couldn't arrive soon enough to replace the WRT12N and much to my pleasant surprise it showed up days ahead of the timeframe Amazon gave for the Super Saver shipping.The WRT54L is a tried and true WRT54 series router that uses Linux firmware instead of Cisco's firmware. That opens up a whole new world in being able to tweak the router's performance by installing a 3 party firmware such as DD-WRT, if desired.For me, that was not necessary as it provides a strong enough wifi signal to be able to connect from any area of my multi level home. But I sure like having that option available even if it's not needed at this time,Installation was a breeze and a much improved process than what I went through with my original WRT54G router.Bottom line...

I tempted fate adding this unit to an existing linksys wired router that came with my Vonage phone system.  My main computer is a Mac, so the install disc (pc only) was not a handy option.  So google time.  Apparently both routers share the same IP address and GASP!!- according to the dire warnings, if I tried to use both devices with the same IP, all kinds of horrible things would happen just short of melting the polar ice caps.  So I judiciously followed all the expert tutorials to change IP and other things, and successfully rendered the unit completely unable to get back on the internet, and totally screwed it up.Since it was working just fine before I ""fixed"" it with this net wisdom, I hit the reset button on the back, rebooted the modem, plugged the unit in and all was fine again.  The only thing I did agree on was to enable security on the unit.So here's my ""expert advice""- Just plug it in and be happy, it's actually pretty foolproof. To use two routers, (at least linksys brand) plug your wireless unit into a free port on the wired unit. The unit has great range, even from a basement.However, unless you don't mind letting others poach/snoop your wireless, - you really should password protect your wireless network.  Plug any computer's (Mac/Linux ok!!) ethernet cable into the router you want to change. Open your web browser, Type the web address of  http 192.168.1.1  you'll be brought to a scary login page, leave the user-name blank, enter passcode ""admin"".  Then go to basic set up: wireless, then security, enable WAP- then create your passcode of choice.  You might also want to rename your network, because if you are in a dense neighborhood, you'll likely see lots of other router networks called ""linksys""... I loved calling my network ""Al Gore's House""...I'll update if otherwise, but after a week no bad things have happened other than enjoying an easy wifi experience.  Besides the Vonage and Mac, I have  a WinXP Pc, ROKU player, an old laptop with linux, Iphone...all of them wireless-  plus the wife's mac which is connected to the vonage router via a powerline system.

I changed the IP address range (because the DSL modem uses the 192.168.1 address space), set the administrator password, chose a name for the Wireless network, enabled WPA2 encryption and picked a passphrase.After that, I connected my laptop to the router right away, and received an excellent signal and throughput of 100 KB/sec (for comparison, my DSL connection maintains a throughput of 300 KB/sec when I connect straight to the DSL modem).I've been using the router for several months now, and have not had any dropped connections (my older Netgear router dropped connections fairly frequently and did not support the newer WPA encryption scheme) and have consistent throughput.  The router has been running constantly for these past few months.For the real tech-heads, this router has customized Linux firmware available from third parties.  I haven't tried this firmware, since the base Linksys firmware more than meets my needs.Finally, good security practices are to:  Change the administrator password, disable Universal Plug and Play, disable Remote administrative access, use a unique name for the access point, and if the network is only for a small number of personal devices (i.e. a laptop you own), enable MAC address filtering.

A3DQWFWINN3V5A,B000BTL0OA,David A. Lessnau,"[3, 3]","I bought this Linksys WRT54GL router to use purely as a Wireless Access Point on my existing wired network.  The process was simple (in general terms, don't connect anything to its WAN port, give it a new IP address, turn off its DHCP Server, and set its wireless values) and the results great (excellent connectivity throughout my house).  My wireless needs are very low (basically, a Wi-Fi connection for my Kindle and for the occasional cell phone).  So, this router (on sale) fit the bill.  Unless and until something unforeseen pops up, I'm rating this at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.  If anyone's interested in the technical specifics of my process, here they are:- To avoid conflicting with my existing wired network, I plugged the WRT54GL into a power supply and attached the provided 5 foot long CAT5E network cable to an isolated computer via one of the numbered LAN ports (not the WAN port -- don't use that for an Access Point).- Upon booting up the computer, I opened my browser and went to the default router location of 192.168.1.1 (the default password is ""admin"").  This brought up the Setup | Basic Setup tab.- In the upper right corner, I noted that the ""Firmware Version"" was 4.30.14.  Previously, I had checked the Linksys support page and downloaded the latest firmware (4.30.15).  So, I went to the Administration | Firmware Upgrade tab and upgraded the firmware.  When that was done, I reset the WRT54GL to it's factory defaults by holding the reset pin on the back for 30 seconds.- My existing network router/DHCP server is at 192.168.1.251 and manages the IP range from 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.149.  So, once I was back at the WRT54GL's default page, I changed the ""Local IP Address"" from its 192.168.1.1 address to something within my existing subnet that wouldn't conflict (192.168.1.10).  I also Disabled the ""DHCP Server"" and set my Time Zone.  I then hit the ""Save Settings"" button at the bottom of the screen (I won't include this ""Save"" process in the rest of my bullets -- just assume it's there).- After it was done, I unplugged the WRT54GL from the power and the computer, and turned off the computer.  I connected the cable from the WRT54GL's numbered LAN port to a port on a switch on my wired network (a port on my router in my wired network would also work), plugged the computer back into the switch, too, and powered everything back up.- This time, I browsed to the WRT54GL's new address of 192.168.10, went to Administration | Management and reset my ""Router Password"" to a good, strong value.- On the Wireless | Basic Wireless tab, I changed the ""Wireless Network Name (SSID)"" to a good, strong value, Disabled ""Wireless SSID Broadcast"", and changed the ""Wireless Channel"" to what I wanted.- On the Wireless | Wireless Security tab, I set the ""Security Mode"" to ""WPA2 Personal"" and entered a good, strong ""WPA Shared Key.""- That's it.  The WRT54GL now functions as a Wireless Access Point.  Since nothing's hooked to its WAN port and its DHCP Server is disabled, all the IP addressing for everything coming through the WRT54GL is handled by my wired network's router/DHCP server.",5.0,Excellent Wireless-G Router to Use as a Wireless Access Point,1298851200,"02 28, 2011"

It's a valid point I guess.- Stability:What I must add to the crowd of 5-star rating is that it is dependable and is rock solid. It just goes running 24/7, and keeps going with no stability issues, no lock-ups, nothing. And most important (and common with other routers): no wireless drop outs. I once ran it for 2 or 3 months I guess, only to be stopped by an energy blackout.Mine is 5 years old (and a few months), and I still use it for routing my home network. I have 3 computers, 1 media player, 1 media server and 1 wireless extender, all together sharing a broadband connection. It handles the load just fine, streaming high bitrate content on wired is perfect. True, the router is very outdated by today's standards (think wifi range and speed), but the fact that I still use it --- if only for routing and handling load --- tells how dependable the box is. You ""set and forget"", no checking, no rebooting, nothing. The fame is due.I bought other routers, and some with the same or similar platform (Buffalo WHR-HP-G54), but they were not as stable as this one. No wonder those always find a way being just an AP, while the WRT keeps routing and doing the hard work.- Features:Granted, I have a 3rd party firmware on it (have used OpenWrt and DD-WRT, now on Tomato), but that's what is good about it. QoS, ""access restriction"" (on/off schedule for wifi), dynamic DNS, time server or any other custom task (if you have the Linux skills) you can imagine. People run everything on them. What I do here is just the ""surface"" of what can be ""scratched"".- Cons:The outdated specs. No N, of course, range and speed seems to be on the bad side.- Support:Years ago, when I didn't know about 3rd party firmwares (that was 2005), I was having a problem with dropped Internet connection. The Linksys support on the web was quick and solved the problem (config). Mind you, after that I never used the support again, so I don't know if Linksys support is still good (or if it ever was and I was just lucky). Not knowing is, of course, a good thing in this case, and speaks favorably for the router.- Final thoughts:That's about it. Buying many things that promise more and deliver less, I'm rarely enthusiastic with electronics, but this one is a winner. Also, not trying other firmwares on this does not do it justice. Installing a 3rd party firmware is also much easier than it used to be, so anyone with reasonable knowledge and the ability to read instructions exactly as written can do it. I didn't search much lately, so I don't think if we have a comparable, proven and trusted 11n kit like the WRT was with 11g.I give it 5 stars, period.

For those of you that know what I am talking about this probably makes more sense. I installed the DD-WRT on this router and setup the router as a bridge repeater. The wiki's on how to do this are easy to google and easy enough if you are remotely technically competant. Once I did that I put this router where the dead spot was and BANG 5 bars and 12 MBPS, 6 times faster.

It has lots of nice security features. I downloadedthe manual before getting the product, so setting up the router wasa breeze.  I like the web interface, which is far nicer than my oldrouter's web interface. I like that I don't have to broadcast my SSID.Both performance and link reliability has been great even though therouter is not located in an optimal place in my house for wirelessconnections. The router is on the main floor. One of my PC'sis on the second floor on the far side of the house with rooms in between.This was my least reliable connection before. Now it works great, thoughthe PCI card I have in that machine is still 802.11b.I work from home a lot and I need a router that works with my company'sVPN. I didn't even have to make any changes to my old VPN configurationand I was able to get on-line just fine with all of my machines.The Linksys came with its own default IP address for the LAN. I simplychanged it to the IP address range I used with my old router and I didn'thave to modify the static IP addresses I was using on any of my systems.I have PC's (new and old), Mac's, and Sun workstations connected eitherwirelessly or with cables.

Pallikal ""Crank""","[3, 3]","I bought this router soley based on on so many favorable reviews and it does not disappoint so far and I'm still using the firmware that it came with. I have had it over a week and no problems. It is on the ground floor and has a direct line to our family's office computer. It also connects my sister's laptop, my netbook, my desktop, and my Nintendo Wii through wireless. Several times we had all of these running together (online gaming, streaming videos, downloading music, surfing, shopping, etc.)In the past two weeks and no problems (with one exception explained below). Even my online matches on Brawl went perfectly well. My wireless card on my desktop shows great reception of 95-100% (usually at 100 and sometimes 98%) compare that to the mid 60s to 70s I was getting on my older routers.Speaking of old routers we used a Belkin(F5D7230-4) and Trednet(TEW-432BRP), and the much newer Belkin N+ (my netbook supports N on 2.4). The big surprise was how bad the Belkin N+ router we bought was. The old Belkin required us to reset it about 8 times a day at the router (which is really annoying when you have to keep going up and down the stairs.) The other two would just frequently drop connection and we would have to wait a minute or two for it to reconnect. Extremely annoying when you are being cut out in the middle of a fierce match on Brawl.Although I recommend the router it may not be perfect for everyone. It did quit on me when downloading multiple large video files on LimeWire. Also obviously it's a G router (or G/B mixed or just B) so if you have equipment that can implement wireless N technology or plan to upgrade your current equipment to take advantage of N then obviously this isn't going to perform as well as routers that support it. Also its somewhat basic no usb storage or or any real fancy bells and whistles or even that great looking but who acres right? Besides the fact that is ahacked and has several other downloadable free firmwares fro it should be another reason to buy it.Anyway if you are like me and have multiple wireless devices that are only G compatible and just are tired of your current router constantly dropping connection GET THIS ONE!I will update if any problems arise and if I decide to change the firmware.",4.0,Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router,1260144000,"12 7, 2009"

For the money you can't do any better I think.  The range is as good as I want it to be since I don't want to attract war drivers.  I actually only use this for our android cell phones which it handles fine; the rest of my network is wired and the mixed network plays well with this device.  If you have a dhcp server on your network, you will want to disable that functionality on the WRT54GL or at least set up non-conflicting address pools.  Personally I need a little more control over dhcp leases than you can configure with this device.I had to set it up twice.  I turned on MAC address filtering and very carefully added all my devices; when I saved the settings I couldn't connect from anything so I had to restore factory defaults and start over.  I'm not sure what happened, but I know I didn't type all the MAC addresses in wrong.  Maybe there is a timeout on connections and I took too long entering the MAC addresses; I did get an error and had to resubmit my changes.  I'll figure that part out later.I'm a little concerned about the setup program; frankly it's pretty lame.  All illustrations and instructions assume the absolute barest network possible, i.e. 1 dsl router plugged into 1 pc with a single NIC, so the entire scenario is designed to have you plug the dsl modem straight into the internet port on the WRT54GL router and use the supplied cable to plug your pc into one of the four 10/100 ports on the back of the router.  Maybe it's the people I hang out with, but I haven't seen very many home ""networks"" that simplistic in a long time.  I plugged the WRT54GL internet port into the switchable port 1 on my aging Netgear switch and plugged the dsl modem into another auto sensing port and the WRT54GL didn't know the difference.  My wireless network still works and the androids have an on site wifi which was my goal.Incidentally, the only setup program provided is the Windows setup.exe.  Whose in charge of this project?After you run the setup program you can connect to the router using the embedded browser based admin tool.  I blinked a couple of times when I saw that the minimal browser based admin program is coded in ASPX which seems strange.  I haven't been out of the business long enough to forget the immense cost of using Microsoft technology; they may forget about the known bugs in their solutions at deploy time, but they never forget to license and charge.  Oh well, at least it works and this is not exactly a backbone router.  Incidentally, the public, non-routable ip address of device is 192.168.1.1 so if you are using that address on something on your network you will need to resolve the conflict.Our cell phones hooked right up and WIFI calling was enabled in minutes, which was the goal.

A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,B000BTL0OA,jjceo,"[3, 3]","I have purchased three of these routers and help install them for people that need simple and reliable WIFI systems in their home. The router is a workhorse that provides reliable and solid performance for years.  The device works on the 2.4 GHz band and is fully programmable. It offers 11 USA Channels for wireless transmission so you select the most open channel to get the best coverage and least interference.  It also provides 10 and 100 MBPS wired ports for your local Ethernet devices to connect to.It supports WEP security and the more secure WPA2 and Wireless Mac Filtering to prevent hackers from using your WIFI.Its data transmission speed is up to 54Mbps at a transmitting signal power of 18dBm (28 mW).  Its user interface software is easy to use but could be intimidating to a novice to WIFI systems.  One of the great features of this device is that so many have been sold and proven reliable that Open Source DD-WRT firmware is available to upgrade this device to a higher level of performance at no additional cost.  One system I installed used two of these routers and installing the DD-WRT firmware allowed me to boost the transmitting power from the default 28 mW to 71 mW (I could have even gone higher) which is a solid performance enhancement.  In addition I was able to install a second WRT54GL unit as an AP by connecting two units together using a hard wired Ethernet cable and basically doubling the WIFI area of coverage for a larger home.  You have to do a little program changing in the AP unit but the data is available on the Internet, just look for it.Being able to do firmware modifications and improving performance makes this router a good buy.  The upgrade to the DD-WRT firmware will void your warranty but enhance the performance and is well worth the time to do it.  Just follow the instructions carefully and all will be OK.I did subtract one star as this router is rather old in design and does not have the newer N-Band at 5 GHz.  The N-Band brings higher data transmission speed, up to 300 Mbps, and allows the concurrent use of two bands to improve throughput in the WIFI system.  It is also very good for streaming movies and large amounts of data but 2.4 GHz will do it also, just slower.  Newer routers can also offer 1 Gigabit wired Ethernet and USB ports for sharing printers and hard drives.  These are things to consider when buying your next wireless router.If you are looking for a good stable router that can be enhanced then this one is a solid choice!",4.0,Most reliable router but a bit dated regarding technology,1323302400,"12 8, 2011"

Security setup took five minutes after the router arrived in the mail and it's been rock solid ever since.I'm a fan for life and I'll tell you why. I've used Netgear for years and have been generally pleased but router rebooting was normally once or twice a week at least. And, then I bought the WGT 624 (v3) model by Netgear and it was one thing after another: my VoIP conversations frequently cut out and hung up; I constantly lost connections; I had to reboot the model up to a dozen times every day in order for my laptops to re-establish a connection.

My family have quite a few wireless devices around the house, and not once has it slowed down, bogged up, or lagged like my previous 2Wire did.

This unit is not at all like many of their other products as far as ease of setup goes.  I recommend using the wizard that comes on the install disk FIRST, it will make the average user's experieince much more pleasant.  However, I needed to add porting and dedicated IP information to mine, including the wireless setup so I bypassed the wizard and that's where it got difficult.  When I set up the SSID (wireless name of network displayed on a smartphone or tablet's wi-fi availability) the unit thought I was somehow ""turning off"" the wi-fi, even though the yellow back-lit panel light indicating wi-fi never went off.  I had to run the wizard to get the wi-fi to turn back on again, which wiped out all my settings, so I had to go back and put everything in a second time and then it was fine after that.  I pity the average user who doesn't understand routers and networking, because, even though this is a nice little unit for the money, it can be ham-fisted when it comes to setup.  Once you've set it up the way you like, be sure to save yourself future trouble by backing up your configuration to a file to a known place on your hard drive (there is a place in the router menus to do this).  That way, you won't have to go through all of the setup again in case it loses it's config.  I've had even professional Cisco products inexplicably lose their programming and go blank during normal use (perhaps a nearby lightning strike wipes them, I'm not sure)  The config file allows you to get everything up and running again rather quickly without having to remember to write everything down, or doing it from memory (even though writing down your settings on the blank ""notes"" page in the manual is good practice).  Otherwise, Cisco products are solid, have the universal networking protocols needed for all devices (including wireless) and have a decent price point for the consumer.

I used to enjoy experimenting with networks when I was younger, so its nice to know I have the options this router allows, but to tell you the truth, I'm so satisfied with what came in the box that I probably won't be changing it any time soon -- in fact I bought another for my parents, who were having a terrible time with the wireless router they rented from their ISP (They are very happy with this router as well.)The signal is strong enough to pick up a hundred feet away, through at least one wall. The encryption package offers several options, including WPA 2. I have had one failure that occurred while I was setting the router up, all I had to do was unplug it for ten seconds to reset, and it has worked perfectly ever since. The directions are very good, clearly written and comprehensive (including security precautions.)The last thing I love about this router is the additional options allowed by the ethernet ports on the back -- all the old computers (including an Apple IIe) came out of the garage and are now connected  to the internet, and to each other.

I've setup half a dozen of these (and older WRT54G v1-4) routers running on Tomato for friends and family.

It is worth noting that this router does not have N support, for that I use a standalone Wireless N access point in conjunction with this router.Second, No router out there has the community base of support that this router (and the prior series) has had.  It isn't the best looking option, but it is by far the most functional single-purpose device you can get.  For years, I and others have hoped for a proper successor to this series, and even the WRT160NL falls short of that promise.

As others have mentioned consumer level support from Cisco/Linksys falls short, fortunately this is a great product on its' own merit.For 3rd party firmware, search for Tomato, DD-WRT or OpenWRT, there are other options out there.

A2JVG81TAJH3LZ,B000BTL0OA,MT Swan Song,"[2, 2]","I purchased this router after our old Linksys WRT54G router quit talking to the Internet...after 8 years of use.  I did not try to update/repair the old one because of its age.  I bought this one because I was impressed with the reliability of the old one, and the excellent reviews it had received compared to others. It was easy to set up, and after one glitch it has performed seamlessly and in the background.I gave the unit a 4 star because of a setup glitch.  At first, when a hardwired computer would be powered up, the router would not connect with the internet unless we shut it off and started it up again.  Then connections worked fine as long as the computers were not powered down.  When restarting any hardwired computer, we had to go through the same repower sequence of the router to get an internet connection.  I contacted Linksys tech via live chat.  He (she?) determined that the router needed a firmware update which we loaded.  Now the router has been working just fine both hardwire (computers and printers/scanners) and wireless from several different laptops.  Wireless connection speed seems very fast, better than the old one.I must say the live chat with the Linksys tech was refreshing.  Hooking up with them was fast compared to other tech support I have had...only a couple minutes.  The tech live chat was courteous and professional with clear instructions on each step to diagnose the problem, download the firmware update, and followup to make sure the router was performing properly.  This time I preferred the live chat vs. phone contact because I could print off the instructions as we were chatting (I am not a computer guru).  The only thing that could have been better is if the router setup CD would have automatically checked for and downloaded updates.",4.0,Linksys WRT54GL setup,1272758400,"05 2, 2010"

A2HILK3XR8B3M3,B000BTL0OA,Nathan Robinson,"[2, 2]","I have read a short review on here saying you must avoid this router if you have an Apple computer. I have 4 Apple devices connected to this thing (an Apple desktop, 2 MacBooks, and an iPod Touch) along with a wireless printer and my Xbox 360.Cisco doesn't provide an installation disc optimized for an Apple computer, so if you need help setting up your WRT54G(L) router with an Apple computer, here are steps for a basic setup:1. Obviously with both devices plugged in (with the power light solid on the router) connect your Apple CPU to the router via ethernet cable, but the ethernet cable must be inserted in either slot numbered between 1 and 4. DO NOT plug the ethernet cable from your computer into the port that says ""Internet."" Not that anything bad will happen, you just won't be able to setup your router through that port.2. Open up a web browser and type 192.168.1.1 in the address bar. Proceed by leaving the name blank and type ""admin"" in the password field. By default, your destination should be in the Setup tab and the Basic Setup sub-tab.3. In the Setup tab, go to the MAC Address Clone sub-tab. Click Enable. Click Clone Your PC's MAC. Click Save Settings. Click Continue.4. This step may not be necessary, but to be safe, go to the Status tab, then by default you should be taken to the Router sub-tab. If the IP Address is 0.0.0.0, click DHCP Release. Click DHCP Renew. Click Refresh. You should now see numbers other than straight zeros. (NOTE: This step is only applicable if your modem is already connected to your router via ethernet with the ethernet cable plugged into the ""Internet"" port (with your Internet connection on and running).)5a. For wireless security, click on the Wireless tab. By default, you should already be taken to the Basic Wireless Setup sub-tab. In the field where it says ""linksys"" next to Wireless Network Name (SSID), go ahead and personalize your router's name. Click Save Settings. Continue. (Unless you're connecting a Nintendo DS to your router, you may want to change your Network Mode to G-Only, and if you're having issues with speed, you may need to toggle the Wireless Channels until you find a speed that works for your device.)5b. In the Wireless tab, go to the Wireless Security sub-tab. You may choose whatever security mode you'd like, but I've chosen WEP with 64 bits 10 hex digits and in Key 1 have typed in a 10 digit personalized password. Depending on the firmware, you may only be allowed to use numbers 0-9 for your wireless password. Click save settings. Continue.And you're done!If you're a parent and don't want your children to hack into your router, you may want to change the password from ""admin"" to something of your choosing by going to the Administration tab and Management sub-tab (you'll see 16 * symbols, but the password is still ""admin"" at this point). Be sure to click Save Settings. If you ever forget this personalized information that you've set up for your router, there is a reset button on the back of your router which will restore the router to factory defaults. Just note that your child is just as capable of hitting this reset button, in which case if they do, I hope you punish them by canceling your next trip to Disneyland. You can also change the Local IP Address on your router, but as smart as children are these days, they can easily figure out what your new Local IP Address is so I don't know if it's worth the effort.As for gaming, on the very box this router comes in, Cisco will tell you that this router isn't the best one to get for multiplayer games (not sure if they mean online or offline) but I have my Xbox 360 plugged in directly to the router via ethernet for Xbox Live. I mostly play Halo Reach. I don't experience any lag when I play matchmaking, but I do experience a lag when I play co-op campaign via Xbox Live unless I'm the host (though I don't receive any lag with the co-op campaign on Halo 3 or ODST). That could be the router, it could be my ISP, it could be the game, but I'm not really sure what it is; I can't say that I really care all that much. If you're a basic gamer, I'm sure this router will do, but if you're an extreme gamer and want the absolute best of the best, you may want to get an N-router.",5.0,Works well with Apple computers.,1298678400,"02 26, 2011"

You have two DSL lines, you have a far corner of the house that does not get good coverage.You want to automatically detect when one or the other line fails and fall over to the working line, and when the lines are both working, you want to balance your load between them.Get a couple of these routers and install the DD-WRT software. This is not for the uninitiated - but the DD-WRT wiki provides excellent install instructions.Use the install instructions for your exact model of router - they vary.Now, I was able to configure the router I have to have not one but two WAN ports, and to automatically do the routing based on things like source IP address, and which box on my lan, and a couple other things.I found instructions for how to balance two DSL lines on one regular Linux box - and they worked just fine on the router - all I had to do was to create a startup script that balanced things out. Simple, no?And I had poor coverage at the back of my house - so I installed another router back there, defined a WDS connection between them, the routers maintain a WDS connection, and automatically ping each other and reestablish the WDS connection if it goes down - and this means that any device in the house can simply attach to the best signal and the routers handle bridging automatically.Like magic, almost.  As compared to the ZyXel router I had, this box/software combo just plain works.  End of story.  The ZyXel AP I used for a couple of weeks had me convinced that I had a laptop with failing wi-fi. Once I de-installed that and put in the Linksys with the DD-WRT software, everything just worked, end of story. And my failing laptop never failed again.The DD-WRT loadout is as reliable as the Linksys loadout.  Plus, you have full Linux networking including the IP command, so you can do advanced load balancing.  You can log in with any ssh client to get a command line - so that you can do pings from the command line by interface. I retasked one of the bridged lines as a second WAN interface - and it just worked.And if you want to set up a commercial access point, there are instructions for how to do that - as well as the ability to set up multiple isolated access points so that you can have one insecure one for customers and a secure one for your business.The five star rating for this router is based on the DD-WRT software load.

The connection was very slow and the Toshiba often just froze up. So, I finally got this WRT54GL.Installation was relatively easy, but I had trouble getting my new router profile to stay as the default connection. I went through about five Cisco customer reps in India to try to get things right. They were unfailingly friendly and polite and I believe they tried their best to help (contrary to what I see in other customer reviews). I finally ended up with Christina who re-configured the connection remotely and made the new router profile stay on top as the default. Hurray!

The modem was a Comcast telephone modem and the user was adding internet and the automatic configuration was not bothered by that.

A24UY2BFLGK163,B000BTL0OA,Peter Besenbruch,"[1, 1]","Updated below.I bought this thing to replace a single port, wired router purchased back in 1997. It was a Linksys, and getting a little flakey. I chose this model, because I thought I might play around with flashing it with the various Linux derivatives out there.I've had it a month, and I haven't done that yet. Since I run Linux, I have to rely on the little Web server it runs to set up the router. Having set up various brands of router this way, I can say the Linksys setup works as well as any.What I like is the stability. There are no more router related hangups, even when pounding this thing. Wireless reception on the opposite end of the house is still at 100%. Yes, it's only G, but the range is superb. Having installed the cut down, 54G in another home, as well as Netgears and Belkins, I can say that the WRT54GL is faster and more stable, even if you don't flash it. It's simply good hardware.Update: I have flashed the unit with the Tomato and TomatoUSB BIOS. I have stuck with TomatoUSB. The most useful thing I have done is incorporate ad blocking in the router. I have also tried using it as a VPN client, but that needs some security kinks worked out.2nd Update: I have been running the 54GL for just over a year. TomatoUSB has proven itself a good, stable workhorse. I especially like the ease of blocking ads with the router, and the ability to regulate the unit's transmission power. I haven't rebooted in six months. Plugging it into a UPS helps with the uptime.3rd Update: It is the end of November, 2013. I just rebooted the router to refresh the ad blocking list. It is the second time this year I did that. The original Tomato programmer quit updating the software, but 4 others have extended the Tomato firmware's capabilities.I note the router is still being sold by Amazon, though it is hopelessly out of date.

But if that is fast enough for your home network - and for most applications it probably is - then you can't so better than this little router.It's simply rock solid. I have one that I've been using for at least 5 years, without a hitch. I rarely, if ever, have to restart it - usually just to upgrade the firmware from Linksys to get feature improvements or better performance. The rest of the time, it's on 24/7. It works just as well as the day I bought it.The stock firmware is lacking a couple of networking features that were on previous models - better logging, NTP options, etc. But really, for most people the stock firmware is just fine. If you do need more sophisticated networking options, there are a number of third party firmware options that provide them - replacing the standard firmware at you own risk, of course.I recently bought a second WRT54GL, and installed DD-WRT on it, to use as a wireless repeater to get a stronger signal in some rooms downstairs.

AXLEZROKSR2M2,B000BTL0OA,R. McKown,"[0, 0]","The WRT54GL + Tomato 1.28 open source firmware was a perfect match for a Wild Blue satellite modem.  Very many wireless routers fail to operate correctly with satellite internet, including a fairly recent Belkin N device which exhibited flawed DNS forwarding behavior connected to DSL and completely unworkable connection timeouts when connected to satellite.  The WRT54GL performed flawlessly on a Qwest 7Mbps DSL for a week-long test, and has been equally flawless since connected to the satellite modem.Tomato firmware is easy to install on the device, though most users may not need it.  There are other 3rd party firmware options as well, but Tomato is a nice balance of features and ease of installation.  Wireless range is in excess of 100 feet from the cabin in which the router is installed, in a sparsely populated mountain community.On the down side, the WRT54GL uses older hardware (G-only, 200MHz processor, etc), won't be good for VPN endpoints, may not be suitable for very high speed VDSL links, and is expensive relative to other options.

At this point in the tally of Amazon Reviews there are seven hundred people who love them and 130 people who hate them.  So why then?

So if you got a 'good one' you love it, and if you got one which does not work reliably then you hate.  With my Linksys router I only get ""three bars"" of reception on my lap top even when the laptop and the router are just a couple of meters apart. So there is plainly a problem with the router.  I got a 'bad one'.  When another router arrives (a Belkin) this one goes into the trash.Linksys has a terrific brand name.

A5YWF3BZZYR95,B000BTL0OA,"Tech Dude ""Dude""","[92, 95]","The WRT54GL is essentially a reissue of the original and classic WRT54G router that LinkSys started selling in 2003.  It is bullet-proof reliable and simply the most upgradeable router you can buy.  You can not only purchase high gain antennas to increase its range, but it has the widest number of open source firmware options of any wireless router.  I purchased mine and then replaced the factory LinkSys firmware with open source DD-WRT, which allowed me to increase the power output on the antenna and offered other advanced features.  My wireless router is now used by my iPhone, a wireless printer and wireless laptop, and is wire-connected to a PC and a Sony PS3.  It works perfectly and its throughput is excellent.  I never have to reboot this router, as I have had to do with newer LinkSys 802.11n models.  And I personally like the classic and timeless industrial design of this router over the newer ""Darth Vader"" designs that LinkSys has put out.Obviously the big downside of this router is that it predates the newer 802.11n or ""N-wireless"" protocol.  I'm a fairly tech-savvy user who always likes to get the latest and greatest in terms of equipment, but I've owned 802.11n routers and I always come back to this router because of its rock-solid reliability.  What most people don't understand is that for most users, the true ""bottleneck"" of their wireless network is their connection to the Internet and not the speed of their wireless router.  I use Comcast cable for my Internet connection, which is pretty fast (averaging about 8.5 mbps), but the LinkSys WRT54GL router can send and receive data at several times the speed of my Internet connection.  That means that even if I had a newer 802.11n wireless router, or even plugged my devices into the network through a wired connection, they would not connect to the Internet any faster then they do through the WRT54GL because the WRT54GL's speed still exceeds the speed of my Internet connection.  For me, the illusory benefits of 802.11n simply do not outweigh the proven reliability and expandability of the WRT54GL.**  UPDATE 05/22/2010 **I have to add one caveat to my review above; having the newer 802.11n may have an additional benefit that I did not mention earlier.  I recently moved to a crowded metropolitan area in a building with a lot of tenants.  The result is that there are now 25 wireless points/routers within close range of my unit (operated by neighbors) that are sharing the frequency bands of my WRT54GL.  The result is substantial interference and moderate to significant performance degradation.  A lot of these are DSL customers who have wireless routers.  I am seriously considering switching to 802.11n simply because it runs at a different frequency (5 GHZ) than 802.11g and is far less prevalent (at least today), which may result in a lot less interference and less performance degradation.",5.0,A classic..

In all cases, this has been a problem-free product.  For basic Internet connectivity, this is all the average residential customer would need.  Although the product is geared toward the hobbyist (Linux support and alternate open source firmware friendly), the standard out of the box firmware is very usable and stable.  This does not support the higher speed WiFi options such as 802.11N or higher.  So, this may not be the device one would want if they are performing streaming connections within a home network (between video servers, televisions, etc.).  However, for standard Internet connectivity, the higher speeds do not provide an advantage since the throttling point is the bandwidth of your Internet connection.  If your broadband connection is 50 Mbps or higher, you might consider a WiFi router supporting 802.11N or higher speed technology.A typical application is to plug this router into a cable modem or DSL modem.  In addition to the WiFi, you can connect a computers to one of four hard-wired Ethernet ports.

However, once I shipped it, they were very prompt in shipping me a ""reman"" unit (another term for remanufactured/refurbished or second-hand).

I've increased my rating to 3-stars after the prompt customer service and return.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I bought the router in August 2011. I have used a similar router before, so setting up was not a big issue. The wireless capability was decent, and it worked okay for a couple of months. I would need to restart it every now and then, as either the speed would get too slow, or my computer (Mac) won't connect wirelessly to it. I wasn't exactly crazy about the product, but it was okay. Until it stopped working absolutely, one fine day in December 2011.The power LED keeps blinking, and all the other LEDs are just lit constantly. I went online and searched for solutions, including a couple of different methods of hard resetting (30/30/30 sec or the 10/turnoff/10/turnon/10 sec). This didn't fix the problem. I tried pinging the default address (192.168.1.1) of the router through my computer via LAN cable, after setting my computer at a static address, which is in the same subnet as the router (e.g., 192.168.1.10 and setting the router/default gateway as 192.168.1.1). It was unreachable. According to certain forums, this is equivalent to 'bricking' your router, if you were trying to install some other 3rd party firmware on it, and failed. I hadn't done anything like that.I finally got around talking to a Cisco rep online. They've decided this is a defective model. They've asked me to initiate a return request through the Cisco RMA department. I am going to ship out this model and wait for the new one and see how that works.A friend has used this model for years without issue, and I was expecting the same. I wasn't totally satisfied with its performance even when it was working, though maybe that was just because of it being defective.

The g2 was not fast enough for the new speed. Fox has an addon net speed checker that is very handy.So, I installed the GL. What a difference! I am getting 12 MPS on the speed checker now. All computers (6) are smoking fast.. I have Century phone/net service in PHX. Excellent company with great customer support.Hint: Write down all settings from the old modem. There is a disk with a PDF file that has excellent directions. I did a manual install using the web menu built in (192.168.1.1). I shut off the old g2 and ran a net cable between #1 switch port (GL) and the net cable input on computer. Bring up browser and type in address. The login  is  user (blank) password (admin).Note: you must save every page you change. There is no save all changes button. Also, be sure to change channel number, 6 is default and I see most routers in our neighborhood are on six (Kindle fire net analyser). AP has some recommendations about that.There is a review by AP that I highly recommend you read. It lists the changes needed to set up the GL (page 2 of newest reviews). I used his list and it worked great. I don't trust the automatic setups usually you wind up in Never Never land and have to reset router.My wireless Sammy laser printers work good on the GL.

Mayhew,"[2, 2]","It just keeps going and going.There may be more user-friendly routers out there for neophytes, but people that are specifically looking for the, ""GL,"" version of this product are most likely not neophytes.  As you might suspect, the WRT54GL is a great platform if you want to try 3rd party firmware such as DD-WRT, Tomato or something else.  I tried both DD-WRT and Tomato on this router and both installed without a hitch.  To be perfectly honest, I don't need this router to act as an IP/Sec tunnel end-point nor have I any need to SSH into my router (what would I do once I SSH'ed there anyway?).  I am just using the stock firmware from Liksys, and it works fine, not needing any attention or reboots whatsoever for at least months at a time.Something to keep in mind is that tweakers think they can boost performance by hacking the power of the RF otuput higher using alternate firmware.  While it is possible, the radio in the WRT54GL will also put out more distortion and more power, so your signal to noise ratio won't improve much, if any, at the receiver.  It is best to stick with the default profile maximum 13 dBm output.  You'd be better off using better antennas with a directional pattern to provide effective gain.  You also can't make the radio receiver in the WRT54GL any more sensitive without a better antenna anyway.  At least the dual RP-TNC connectors on the WRT54GL make it easy to experiment with improving the antennas and/or amplifiers.There are newer sleeker looking products that may have more fun LEDs and curvy plastic cases to entertain you.  The WRT54GL is well made and will last years if you don't absuse it or expose it to harsh dusty or wet conditions.  The most likely weak spot in a conusmer grade product is the wall-wart power pack.  Cisco/Linksys have been going back and forth on what they supply for the power pack.  In the two WRT54GLs that I most recently bought from Amazon, the power packs have iron core trnasformers instead using capacitor based switching regulators.  The transformer based power packs will probably out-last power packs that use switching technology to lower the wall voltage to operate the router.I have several WRT54GLs and several of their older WRT54 Linux based predecessors and have found they perform well and will last at least several years in a home environment.  I haven't had any of the WRT54GLs fail, but I did have an older WRT54 die at almost the end of it its warranty.
