The instruction book was phenomenal: they give you 4 different ways to pair your devices. I thought that finally someone had worked out the problem of the universal remote. I was wrong. I was able to program in 2 devices to the new remote, but after a while, the remote stopped remembering them. I tried it again to be sure, and with new batteries. Same problem. Yes, I did ""save my work"" as the manual cautions. The device didn't keep the programming in its memory. Also, it never was able to pair up my Toshiba DVD player.

Dude,"[0, 0]","Don't get me wrong, this remote works for the most part.The biggest issue I have with it is that it's simply uncomfortable to hold in your hand and depress the MAIN buttons, channel up/down, volume up/down, guide, input buttons...It's got a very nice thick grip to it on the bottom 2/3 of the remote, but up top where all the important functionality lies, it tapers off to quite a thin profile, making it difficult to quickly access most used buttons. It simply feels weird in the hands. Some might not notice this, but I sure hate the crud out of it.It works functionally, well enough. There are some codes that this remote just doens't seem to want to learn at all. There are some functions that could have been planned out better, such as discreet coding. A direct button to make your TV got to say, input 3 or hdmi 2 would have been appreciated. My remote's favorite channel buttons don't seem to play well with Verizon's boxes, so I can't comment on those. It'll get the basic tasks done though.The backlight is in THE.ABSOLUTE.WORST place on the remote, all the way at the bottom. You either have to use your free hand, (if you can pry your beer away from your fingers) or inch downward a number of times to manipulate it. And that's assuming that you can FIND the button in all it's darkened, blackened glory in the dark. What good is that?I bought it on Black Friday and got a screaming deal on it, but I think after this long, I should have at least gotten used to using it already.

Apparently, Vizio like to be the only brand in the house. I hated having to use multiple remotes to watch a show, so I tried a universal. I went through several, due to Vizio's stubbornness. There were NO usable codes out there that would make this Vizio work with a universal remote. So when I found the WR7, I was skeptical. But, I figured I'd give it a shot, since it said it had multiple ways to program in other devices. The auto method didn't work, the code method didn't work, but the learning method sure did. The WR7 has a larning method which allows you to simply put the infrared transmitter of the remote belonging to the device you want it to control. Then you start punching buttons and the WR7 &#34;learns&#34; everything the offending remote knows. My Vizio is now completely controlled by the WR7. And I have even been able to set up macros allowing me to touch one button and perform multiple operations in series. As for feel, it's not too bad.

A32SDHG6VBJ505,B001KC08A4,Amazon Customer,"[4, 6]","The article below about this remote was first published in my blog at [...]:The picture on my new 40"" Samsung LCD HDTV is amazing, but the sound, not so much. So I plugged the audio output of the television into the auxilliary jack for my Bose Wave Radio. Much better! But then I encountered a new problem. When the TV audio is external, the TV remote can't control it. Luckily the radio has a remote (otherwise I'd have to walk across the room to mute the TV when the phone rings), but I'd rather have the TV volume on the same remote as the rest of the TV controls.First I tried to set the auxilliary button on my Time-Warner Cable remote to the Bose radio. The cable remote instructions list these codes for Bose audio equipment: 070, 170, 224, 374, 409, 460, 532. I tried them all, but none of them worked. So then I tried the scanning method, holding down the channel button until the radio turns off. But it never turned off.I did an internet search on controlling Bose devices with universal remotes and found a plethora of contradictory information, none of which solved my problem. So I called Bose customer support. Their products may be pricey, but they sure have good customer support. I got someone on the phone immediately, and he was knowledgeable. He explained the problem instantly and gave me the solution.And now I'm sharing it with you. Here is the missing piece of information that seems to exist no where else on the internet.YOU NEED A ""LEARNING"" REMOTEMany people think that the Bose codes don't work because Bose remotes use radio frequencies rather than infrared. But this is only true in their high-end home theatre equipment. The Bose Wave Radio remote does use infrared, but - and this is the missing piece - Bose did not set up codes for programming a universal remote. You can't find the right code because there is no code. To control a Bose device, you need a universal remote with ""learning"" capability. It has to be one of those remotes where you put the original remote nose-to-nose with the universal and ""teach"" the universal by pressing the corresponding buttons.You don't need a $200 Logitech Harmony remote to do this. I spent some time looking at the extremely complex manual for the Harmony and decided no way. I found another remote that is nearly a tenth the price and, in my opinion, far better: Universal Remote Control URC-WR7. I got it for $27 at Best Buy. Amazon is currently selling it for $21.44.It took just a minute to get it working with my Bose Wave Radio. Even better, I have it set up so the volume controls for my TV and Blu-ray both use the Bose device. You can't do that with any other universal remote. It's a feature they call ""punch through"", and it's fantastic. You can make functions from any device available from any component. A reviewer for the Sony Universal Remote complained that it switched to the TV component whenever you pressed the volume control, so beware of that one!Tip on using the learning function with the Bose remote: Holding down the volume Up or Down button is a different command than a single press of Up or Down. You need to program both into the universal remote.The URC-WR7 also has macro capability. I set it up so when I turn the TV on or off, the Bose Wave Radio turns on or off, too. There are other things you can do with the macros - I haven't finished exploring all the features.So no, you don't need a separate remote for volume if you use a Bose Wave Radio to output the audio for your TV. It's easier and cheaper than you think - you just need the right universal remote.",5.0,The PERFECT remote - control Bose equipment and more,1263600000,"01 16, 2010"

Both were powerful but complicated.  I realized that I didn't need to duplicate every function of every remote I had, but just something to automate the most common uses I had.  This remote is awesome for that.  If I want to turn everything on, I push the system on button, if I want to watch a DVD I push the DVD button, etc.  I was able to program each main job to one button so all the commonly-used controls are intuitive.  It is a bit tricky to do the basic setup (map the DVD controls to my DVD player, etc.) and I had to individually program a few buttons from my single remotes, but once I was done it all works.  I can finally use just one remote to do everything I need and the couple times I needed it to do something special, I was able to program that button to work.

My TV, my Roku, and my DVD player(which had no remote of its own). The auto scans did not work for me, but I have pretty odd devices I guess. What I really liked is that to set it up there are three different options, and you can use them together. You can do an auto scan, where the remote tries to figure it out itself, you can enter in some three digit codes from the back for the device you need, you can basically scroll through all the codes one by one to see if you can find one that works, or you can just manually program your new remote using your old dedicated remote.This last option worked great for my Roku. Since it is such a random new device and has odd buttons I was able to easily program it to map the keys how I wanted.I did a three digit code for my TV and that got almost all the keys, but I was able to also add the keys that did not get mapped and got to remap some of the keys I wanted to different locations. That was really nice and flexible.I was a little afraid with my DVD player because it has no remote of its own, but a three digit code got all the keys I needed.I love how there are 4 'random' buttons on the bottom of the remote to map for whatever you want.

Both independently confirmed that the WR7 will NOT work with the Roku 3...except for the exception...read on.Codes for the WR7 are hard-programmed into it at time of manufacture, and it cannot be updated. There are no Roku codes for the WR7.The WR7 is IR only. It can only emit IR, and it can only learn from other IR remotes.Some older Roku remotes emit IR so the WR7 can learn from them and work fine. HOWEVER, the new Roku 3 remote emits RF signals only, not IR. So the WR7 can't ""learn"" from it. Period. (To add to the confusion, the Roku 3 module itself can *receive* either IR or RF signals, but the provided remote only *emits* RF signals.)So if you have an old Roku remote lying around, you may be in luck. In my case, I'm SOL.That being said, I do like the WR7 a lot, and will likely keep it because it does work with our Vizio HDTV, TiVo, and Samsung sound bar. The macros work great to switch back and forth between various TV inputs and audio outputs with one touch.I want to reiterate a tip from a previous reviewer that really helped me: when programming macros, make the first step a ""pause,"" which will preserve the original function of the key unless you hold it down to initiate the macro.You can also use ""pause"" in macros as needed to give your equipment time to keep up with the steps. In my case my sound bar couldn't keep up with the five advances of mode in a row; programming a pause between each advance did the trick.One reason I chose this remote is the placement of the skip- button, which I successfully programmed to do the ""replay"" function of our TiVo remote, which we use a lot. Many other remotes do not have an intuitively placed button for replay function.This is my first universal remote so it did take a fair amount of time with the manual to figure out how to program it, but by evening I had some complicated macros working perfectly.When I first opened the package I was surprised at how big it is, but it is well laid out and feels comfortable in the hand. The light works great with the translucent silicone buttons. The light button also turns the light back off, so you can use it for just a sec to find what you're looking for.Overall I feel the WR7 is a great value for the money, especially if all your equipment is IR compatible. I wish they had clearly stated in the product description that it is incompatible with the Roku 3, since the Roku 3 is so popular now. I'm dinging it two stars only because I still have to use two remotes instead of ""one to rule them all"" as I had hoped for.",3.0,Can't learn from my Roku 3 remote,1374624000,"07 24, 2013"

I bought the remote since we think our 14 month old threw away our DVD remote or at least put it in a place we haven't found it yet.  I must say that it was relatively easy to setup.  I used the Quick Set-Up Method function to setup my LG LED TV and Phillips DVD, which took less than 1 minute.  The only glitch was setting up the remote with my Toshiba Tivo DVR.  The Quick Set-Up Method didn't work or entering the ""001"" code, which was the only code available for the Tivo.  I tried the Auto-Search Method for about 5 minutes and that didn't work either.  Thankfully I had my Tivo remote and was able to use Learning Method, which worked perfectly.  I haven't tried to setup any other features on my remote or components.  Given the cost and functionality, I'm very happy with the remote.

A2F8ZNKN9K592G,B001KC08A4,"Ashton Pitts ""ashtonpitts""","[1, 1]","I have had many remotes.  My last three have been the Harmony Remotes.  This remote is not fancy, but it does what it says.  The quick start programing got my Samsung TV and Blu-Ray player on the first try.  My Verizon FIOS box simply needed the code inputed and then it worked.  My Apple TV also just took the code provided in the user manual.  I had 1-2 buttons that did not work as hoped with my Verizon DVR box, so I tried the ""learning"" function and presto, now that buttons works as well.  I found the instructions very easy to follow and set up was a breeze.  Here is the thing, if you have a VERY complex home theatre system with an amp, multiple sound field adjustments, input/output options, source functions,etc. then maybe the Harmony is for you.  If however, like most people I have found, you have a simple sound system like a Soundbar along with a TV, AppleTV, BlueRay Player and Cable/DVR box, this is all you need.  I also set up some advanced functions with this remote such as using my Sound bar to be the primary sound for ALL components regardless of the device used so sound on say the DVD device always defaulted to sound control of my soundbar.  Yes, it even has these advance functions to set up and I follwed the provided instructions, very easy to set up.  With my Harmony remote I had a ton of problems with other folks using the buttons on the Harmony remote.  It took so long for it to run through it's sequences and the buttons were small.

A31P98LCAYNPZS,B001KC08A4,Avid Techie,"[4, 4]","EDIT 7/15/2013: WARRANTY WARNING! I've had 3 of these remotes for about 8 months.  1 stopped working so I called the manufacturer for a replacement.  At first they refused to honor the warranty claiming ""Amazon is not an authorized seller of this product"". I challenged them since they actually link to Amazon on their site for purchase of this product.  They capitulated but require me to pay to ship the defective unit back (over half the cost of buying a new one!!!).  This has been a huge hassle.  I will NOT buy anything made by this company again.Pros* The setup manual is decent (much better than the 1 pagers most universal remotes come with)* There are 4 ways to program the remote:1. ""quick setup"" which auto programmed the control for all the main stream devices I tried in a few seconds with no other knowledge;2. ""auto find"" which sequentially tries all built in programs (took longer than 1, about 2-3 minutes in some cases to find the right codes);3. ""manual code entry"" - basically you look up your equipment by manufacturer and try various codes for it4. ""learning mode"" - lets you ""copy"" other remotes by pointing the other remote at the URC remote and it will learn the code (great for older devices or less common devices that are not supported by most universal remotes)* Doesn't lose your settings when you change batteries (supposedly you can leave the batteries out for months and it will be fine)* Supports ""macros"" (the ability to program a button to send multiple signals such as turn on 2 devices at the same time)* Lighted buttons (also a con below)Cons* The red button light is pretty harsh in my opinion.  I would have preferred a soft blue or green backlight.* Deleting some of the advanced key options (such as multi-device on/off) didn't work for me; I had to reset the unit to factory defaults and start over which was inconvenient.* The remote is fairly large.* There are a couple of missing common keys such as a ""my dvr"" button (to replace the Tivo, Recorded Programs, etc from DVR remotes) and ""sleep"" button.  There are 4 generic keys at the bottom that can be used so this is not a show stopper but for people not familiar with your remote it will not be intuitive.I'm using this remote to control the following units:- Toshiba 55"" LED LCD TV (""#4"" in quick setup)- Charter Communications DVR (made by Motorola - 074 device code)- Onkyo receiver/amplifier (had manually program using the ""learning mode"" as none of the Onkyo codes worked)- Patriot Box Office Core media streamer (also had to manually program)It controls all of them flawlessly.

For example, we don't have cable so I programmed the &#34;favorites&#34; buttons to use the soundbar features, so I wish I could add a little sticker or something to cover the existing buttons to indicate what we actually use those buttons for.The number of components it works with is wonderful, and if it doesn't have the code (like our Vizio soundbar), as long as you have the original remote, it's very easy to teach this remote to play nicely with any component.  If you don't have the original remote, there is a way (according to the manual) to try to find a code that will work with a particular component, but I haven't needed to try that feature.  It also has a nice feature in which you can program it so that the volume and mute buttons work for every component.  You can also set up macros so that one button is programmed to do a number of things.  I haven't tried that yet since our TV system isn't that complicated.Also, one tip, for components with multiple codes, you don't have to settle for the first code in the manual that seems to work.  For example, the first code to work with our TV, didn't seem to handle certain features on the original remote (like the menu).  So, I tried the second code and that handles nearly all of the features on the original remote.

I expect to get most of the functions of the OEM remote on a decent universal, not all, but certainly more than on and off and input selector.

Another example: There isn't a ""List"" button to display DVR recorded shows, so I selected a random button that wasn't being used for something else and assigned that function to it. I chose the button with the green line at the bottom, simply because my old remote had a bright green button on it for that function. Altogether I had 10 commands like that.

The perfect universal remote simply doesn't exist; at least today.The URC WR7 has some redeeming qualities and it also has its share of unnecessary frustrations.Ergonomics - Based on other reviews, I was expecting to get a device that would be difficult to handle with one hand because of the described size.  It does not feel that awkwardly big to me although it is larger than average.  It can be handled easily by the average person with one hand.Build Quality - Surprisingly very good for this or any price point.On the Table Stability - It has feet and lays nicely on a table; no curvatures that would cause it to rock from side to side.Buttons - They feel very good and easy to depress.Programability - Despite some of the complaints, I think the directions are well written and the methods used to program the device are sound.  URC provides multiple ways to program the remote; including the standard code method and button learning feature.  Unfortunately, the act of programming the remote does not always yield the expected results.  I found that the unit's programming logic to become flawed at times, requiring a battery pull to reset the unit and try again.  I also found there are some infrared signals the remote simply could not learn from other remotes.  There are also some buttons that cannot be reprogrammed at all.Backlight - Although it has a nice red backlight, it only comes on if you press the backlight key.  It would be nice if it automatically backlit regardless of which key is depressed.  Although the red backlight looks cool, I'm not sure about its effectiveness.What would make this remote better?- fix the programming bugs.- the ability to recognize all infrared signals from other remotes (example in case someone from URC is reading: the Video button from a Sony RM-U252 remote).- add more buttons to the remote.  The WR7 has plenty of real estate for this.  It doesn't include DVD eject nor a Sleep button as examples.The perfect remote?- add an RF learning ability (I have three remotes that use RF signals including a light and fireplace insert).  The consumer doesn't want to hear about the ""why"" it doesn't work; we just want a single remote.- allow programming by activity (the higher end models do this and it requires an on-board display).  Unfortunately, not everyone can afford a remote at those price points; especially when they cost as much as a TV.- figure out how each button can be dynamically labeled; this is the big challenge but I'm convinced it can be done.  The manufacturer that solves this wins the universal remote competition.Do I recommend the WR7?  For twenty bucks, it's well worth it.  You will spend several hours programming it and you'll likely reconfigure it later on once you've had a chance to think about it more.  However, your spouse is not going to flip cart-wheels because you've solved your remote complexity unless all you have is, say, a TV and DVD player.  In that case, this would be a great universal remote.

Considered logitech, but no way paying that kind of money. Had one years back and hated it.Found one at Target while casually shopping. It looked cooler than the others and only $25 made me at least pic it up for a look. I scanned the UPC code with my Android and took me to amazon website. This thing has 285 reviews and 4.5 out of 5 stars. WHAATT! No way I said. Never even heard of this thing. I took it home, read the manual and programmed every freakin remote in my house into this thing, including all the buttons on the HD33 remote and believe it or not, my Favi HD120 Electric screen. It blew my mind. I actually hate the HD33 led blue glow. Kills my eyes while trying to adjust image in the dark, and after looking into the intense blue glow, my eyes are all screwed up for a few moments.I can seriously say that this one remote operates my 3D bluray Player, DVD player, HD DVR Cable box, LG 55"" LED TV, HD33 and Favi Electric screen and my Technics DTS Receiver. I have every button from the old remotes ""learned"" into this Universal remote. It controls every function of the other remotes. You have to teach it.

A1A9C7QJ6FMPAB,B001KC08A4,chivyguitar,"[3, 3]","I've thrown away a lot of universal remotes over the years. There's too many components out there for a remote to reliably be manufactured to work with them all. Especially with new components released after the remote was designed.To solve this problem, you need a remote with learning capabilities. This remote solves that problem.I ordered one of these as a tester on our bedroom TV and sound system, and will be ordering another for the living room. This remote has fulfilled all of my expectations, and the price is great.Within 15 minutes, I had the remote programmed to control my newish Insignia TV, brand new Philips DVD/surround sound combo unit, and Apple TV. The manual is well written and well designed, and the setup process is a breeze.A few buttons didn't work as expected, or at all. Enter the learning function. I quickly learned several buttons from multiple remotes, and had them working perfectly. Then, I configured the volume punch through function, so that the volume buttons control the DVD/sound system, regardless of which component I have selected for control. Then I configured the Macro On/Off, and a couple of other macro functions.The result is a remote that controls all of my components reliably, and is dead simple to operate. I hit POWER ON, everything turns on. I have complete control over the Apple TV, or basic TV operations. The volume buttons automatically route to the DVD/surround sound system. I never have to switch from TV to DVD just to turn the volume up or down. Everything just works.The IR blaster is strong and reliable. The buttons always register. This is a big step up from the cheap remote that came with the Philips DVD sound system. With that remote, I routinely had to hit a button 3, 4, 5 or more times for the command to register. This remote is vastly superior. I'm now able to mount my Apple TV to the back of my TV, and it still functions properly by bouncing the IR signal off the wall/ceiling.All programming is stored in an on-board flash chip inside the remote, so even if the batteries are out for a year, you won't have to reprogram anything.I know its just a remote and I shouldn't be gushing this much, but its victories like this that help immensely with day to day life. Eliminate friction, simplify. I highly recommend this remote.",5.0,Simple things make a big difference.,1377820800,"08 30, 2013"

I use it to run a Samsung Smart TV, Sony DVD, Samsung sound bar, and Comcast Cable box.  If you follow the instructions, it's easy to program.Cons:  Since it has no display, I forget which buttons I used for some commands.  For example, on my Comcast remote, there's a ""live"" button you can push if you rewound a show...hit ""live"" and jumps right back to live TV.  On this remote, there isn't a ""live"" button, so I programed that command to another button....but forgot which one after a while.  The same with stuff on the sound bar, etc.  My old (super expensive) one had a display, which no matter what others say, makes it much easier.The buttons are little sensitive, if you don't punch them exactly in the center they don't always work, and you really need to point it right at the device, a little like an old-school remote.BUT....it's super cheap and works.

The URC WR7 was just what I needed.PROS-1. PRICE.  I was not going to spend over 50 dollars on a universal remote, and I ended up paying much less than that.  I highly doubt you could find a universal remote this good for the price.  I think the remote could easily compare to some of the remotes that cost 100+.2.  FUNCTION.  It was very easy to set up this remote.  The are codes in the manual and you just put the remote at your device and press in the code.  It is a very easy process.  I have all 5 of my devices programmed on this remote within 10 minutes.3.  STYLE.  The remote has a great button layout.  The buttons on the remote, and the location of the button are great.  It makes it very easy to memorizes.  It also have a light button at the button that lights the buttons up red for about 15 seconds.  This can be very helpful.4.  PROGRAMMING.  The remote has an easy button function.  This can train the URC to learn any button on one of your other remotes if the URC does not already have that button.  I only had to do this for 2-3 buttons, but it is a very easy process which is told in the manual.5.  MACROS.  This remote can memorize a sequence of actions among your devices.  Say you have you TV connected to a dvd player, and listen to it on surround sound.  You can train you remote so you could just hit the TV on button and the dvd player and surround sound will automatically turn on.  You can also do this for your devices turn off.CONS-NONE!I would recommend this remote to anyone who does not want to break the bank or a high priced remote.

A3AFLFLAZR3DEX,B001KC08A4,C. Richardson,"[3, 3]","I have had this remote for about a week now, got it programmed to work everything, and must say I am very impressed. I am going to rundown what I have working and how it works:TV- Samsung 50"" plasma (TV button)Receiver- Yamaha RX673- Purchased on Black Friday on Amazon for a great price (AUD button)Blu Ray- Panasonic (DVD button)Roku- Older model that receives IR signals (DVR button)Apple TV (AUX button)XBOX 360 (CD button)Dish network using the Joey (Sat/Cable button)OK, everything but the Xbox and the Roku was easy to program in with the single and 3 digit system for this remote. All I was worried about was it turning that component on or off, as I used the learning program for all of the rest of the functions. The learning program for this remote is great, and I really had no problems getting the components to learn the different keys. It does take a little while, so if you don't have any patience, continue using the other remotes that you have. I never was able to get the Xbox to work, as I use the AUX button for the Apple, but that is ok as my son uses it most of the time, and he can get off his butt to turn it on. Probably will be the only exercise that he gets for the next three hours anyway. I had to to teach the remote all the commands for the Roku, took about three minutes. If you have a newer model Roku that uses RF, borrow an old remote from a friend or buy one off Ebay to learn the codes.All of my components connect through HDMI to the receiver, and then one to my TV. I used the audio punch through to work the volume on the receiver for all components. Works great, no issues at all. Now to the macros. I used the component buttons to run these macros. You have to use the pause button as the first step for any component button to run the macro. This lets the remote know that you are using the component button for a macro, not to simply switch to that component. Holding the component button down for a few seconds will run all the steps of the macro. Works great. For example, I press and hold the AUX button, it selects the TV button, turns on the TV, selects the AUD button, turns on the receiver, selects the number 5 button which is the input for the Apple TV on the receiver, selects the AUX button. This macro turns on the TV, receiver, and leaves me on the Apple TV. Friggen' awesome. I did the same for the Roku, Dish, and DVD.I can't turn on or off the Xbox, but I set up the macro on the CD button to turn on the TV, receiver, and switch it to that input so it is ready to go and be turned on manually. I set up the total system off to turn off the TV an receiver at once. The system on for the same components.I am fully appreciating the value of a good home theater system, and this remote makes it even better. I was considering a Harmony, but could not justify the price. Really, for $25 this remote could break after a year and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another.

I did not believe all of the reviews I was seeing, then I went and looked back at how in depth everyone's review was and then I said hey. let me give this a shot. I do not regret thinking this one single bit.first of all, the design of this remote is a real eye catcher, seriously I have a 40"" Samsung LCD, and this remote is way nicer in comparison. Not just the looks, but all of the buttons are well sized and have good spacing, and the buttons go down when pushed. So it was time to set this up, I bought this for a 26"" Samsung TV for my mom, that she keeps in her room, never have I used a universal remote that was so easy to set up. So how did I set it up? Easy, all I did was hold down the ""TV"" button, the TV button blinked a couple of times, and then according to the instructions all you do is hold the power button, and press from 1-10 one by one, that's it! By the time I hit number 4 the TV and remote was already fully programmed. In literally 20 seconds, I connected this to the TV and was shocked how easy it has gotten to connect these remotes. You basically leave the TV on, and then by the time I hit 4 the TV shut off itself, that's how I knew that it already worked, seriously amazing. The reason this happens as well, is this is one of those learning remotes, punching in numbers has become a thing of the past.There are those really cool glow in the dark all red buttons, and the Red is bright and has a good glowing radius as well. The whole button is illuminated, it is like something out of Tron. Im seriously considering buying another one of these remotes, for my Samsung television!Are there any cons? Yeah there is one con, and one con only, that is this TV remote is HUGE, I mean it's even longer then those Direct TV/Dish Network remotes, not sure if that is bothersome but I figured id mention it, on the flip-side it is substantially lighter despite the length.

If I want a button to learn and do something, it should just do what I tell it to (which happens 99% of the time, but fails mysteriously in this case).#2: in AUX mode, many of the directional commands don't work when I press the button once, I have to press them twice, I can't figure out why. Maybe it's not fair of me to blame this on this remote control, because it might work if I press the button repeatedly on the original remote control when learning (a way of changing the button behavior, as mentioned in the manual).

Programming the TV, Cable, and Audio worked fine, but only by manually inputting the codes.  The ""quick set-up"" feature did not work at all.  Next, the Aux button should allow you to program gaming systems.  That's actually a big reason why I bought this, as I was tired of using a PS3 game controller to watch DVDs.  This feature also did not work.  Finally, the ""Total On/Off"" feature should allow you to program your remote so that you can turn on/off multiple systems at the same time.  Unfortunately, no matter how many times I tried and reset the remote, the systems would sometimes turn on when pressing the off button, and off when pressing the on buttton.  As a last resort, I called customer service.  The rep couldn't have cared less and then put me on hold for 10 minutes.  By the 11th minute, I hung up.  On another note, the remote does not have a ""list"" button.  So for those who want to watch programs you have saved on your DVR, you will be S.O.L.",1.0,Beware!,1329177600,"02 14, 2012"

It has volume punch through and total system off/on.I have a large screen Samsung TV, Samsung Smart Hub Blu-ray DVD player and a Sony AV receiver. I don't have cable hooked up to my ""man cave"" TV but it would easily handle it if I did. Setup was a breeze and it did all that I wanted which was:1. Control everything without me having to switch component buttons.2. The volume punch thru allows the vol and mute buttons to control the AV receiver which is where all of the sound comes from. I don't use the TV speakers for sound.3. The system ON/OFF allows a one button push to turn everything on or off in sequence but with only one button press.I use the DVD player to stream Netflix, play movies in MP4 format from an external harddrive, play DVDs and stream Pandora or Hulu. I purposefully did not connect cable to this TV system but it would easily handle it. All of the content comes from the DVD player so the only control that I need for the TV is off/on and all I need from the AV receiver is vol control. Most will of course have TV channels but mine is purely a movie or streaming system. The cable TVs are upstairs. Therefore all the buttons that I need are accessible without pressing any component buttons. It stays on DVD.Some universal remotes don't handle an AV receiver. The Harmony 520 is good but not as good as this and definitely not as good for almost ten times the price. I simply like this remote better.Push the light button located at the bottom and the remote keys light up a bright red.

This remote allowed me to create a macro that moved through the TVs menu system and select the correct option, all with a single press of a button from me.

This makes it hard for kids (mine are 4 and 9) to manipulate. There is a long delay when using macros. My kids and wife rarely keep it pointed in the right direction long enough for even the power on or off macros to complete and this causes the devices to get out of sync. It's not consistent: sometimes the power macro does the right thing and leaves the primary control on the device I set it for last, but randomly it will switch back to the first device.

The other reviews here detail how great it is.I thought I would point out a shortcoming not limited to this universal remote, but to most of them. This problem stems from the fact that in most cases a single remote signal is used for off/on of a given device.Where this causes a problem in in scenarios like this: Say I wanted to program a macro to turn my tv, av receiver, and cable box on. That is easy enough. Then say I want to program a macro so that when I hit DVD it will turn on my blu ray player and change my tv and av receiver inputs accordingly. No problem. Now say I want program a macro so that I hit AUX and it turns on my XBox 360 and changes tv and av receiver inputs accordingly. Still no problem. Now, say I want to go back to my blu ray - I hit DVD which sends the signal to switch my tv and av receiver inputs back for blu ray but it also sends the remote signal to power cycle my bluray - since it was on from previously switching to it, now my macro turns it off.The problem is that any macro (whole system on/off, switch to component, etc) that includes sending a component a on/off signal is entirely dependent on the power status of the component being in the on/off state that you intended when you programmed the macro.It would be nice if all component used discrete codes but most in fact use a single 'toggle' code that turns a device on (if it is off) or off (if it is on). This makes programming macros less than idiot proof, especially if the person operating the remote is not familiar with the system, ie grandma, mother in law, etc.In any case, this is not a problem with this remote per se', moreso a limitation of universal remotes. Just something to be aware of. Otherwise this remote is the best there is for the price range but if you are expecting true 'one touch' operation for a typical home theater setup then you might want to think again.",4.0,Great value but some caveats,1360281600,"02 8, 2013"

I didn't want to spend a lot of money, and found this remote.The item ships well-protected in a clamshell box, which you'll need scissors to open.Programming instructions are very clear. Programing, as other reviewers have noted, is not as easy as with more expensive remotes and will take some patience and tweaking. I first used the &#34;Quick Set-up&#34; option, which is very easy for anyone to use. It worked great for the TV and the Xbox 360. The other devices required using the &#34;Learning Method&#34;, where you position the remotes head-to-head, press a function button on the Universal remote, then press the same function button on the device's remote. This worked well, but took some time.The trickiest part was programming &#34;macros&#34; - steps done in sequence with a single button press. For instance, pressing the &#34;AUX&#34; button turns on the TV, the Xbox 360, and the Receiver, and sets the receiver to the proper channel for Xbox sound. First attempts didn't work too well, then I realized I had to program &#34;pauses&#34; between steps. Once I did this everything worked fine.All told, it took me over an hour to program this remote, and I consider myself above-average in technical savvy.

I NEVER try to use the preprogrammed codes, always using the learn function to acquire the programming from the original remote.  It's developed one odd problem over time - the commonly used buttons, such as the channel change buttons, become intermittent and you have to really press hard to get them to operate.  I took the control apart and discovered a fluid substance on the rubber keypad backing where the buttons contact the circuit board. I cleaned the rubber section and the circuit board with a Q tip and Windex and after that the buttons operated as they did when the control was new.  About a year after this problem, it happened again and when I disassembled the remote, I found the same fluid there again.  Another cleaning solved the problem.  I suspect the fluid source is the rubber membrane.  There's never been anything spilled on the remote, so it has to be coming from the inside.  At any rate, the remote continues to operate and since the internal contacts didn't show much sign of wear I suspect it will last another few years.  A good price performer and a great remote (if you are capable of performing the cleanup I described).",4.0,Long term user report,1351555200,"10 30, 2012"
A1TUUSQODOPXOE,B001KC08A4,"Frank Forrest ""Quasar""","[2, 2]","You may have noticed the wide range of review ratings on this product from 5-stars to just 1-star. This had me a bit worried before I purchased this unit, but since Amazon backed up their products with its excellent return policy, I took a chance on it.First off, for those who haven't ""programmed"" a universal remote before, the steps and instructions can be a bit scary or involved. You must read carefully regarding the sequence of buttons you must push in order to get this to work with your devices. There are basically three ways to do this and if one doesn't work, you have two other fallback plans.For me, I choose to just input the different codes available for my TV, DVD, VCR, and Xbox 360. The WR7 lists several codes for each device and you input each one until one turns off your device. In some cases, multiple codes work but only one will give you full functionality.For my outdated Realistic VCR from Radio Shack, none of the codes worked, so I did the ""automatic"" scan method where you just tell the WRC WR7 to go through a list of pre-programmed codes. Once your device recognized one, it will turn off. As it turns out, the code it used was for a Panasonic VCR, which means the Radio Shack unit was made by Panasonic.In addition, I used the ""learning mode"" to program the WR7 to take over all of my Roku LT's functions. But according to various websites, because the WR7 only works with IR remotes, later models of the Roku cannot be programmed into the remote. It also should be pointed out that the directions for the learning mode of the WR7 may be in error. After programming, in some cases you will need to hit the component button again before ""saving your work.""Basically, I can understand the frustration some users of the WR7 have experienced because there is a somewhat steep learning curve if they haven't programmed a remote before. Also, after reading many of the 1-star reviews, it seems that a good deal of them have to do with user error, impatience, or just unrealistic expectations.I was able to program the WR7 between breaks watching streaming videos with my Amazon Prime account. Total time actually spent on programming was about 30 minutes--most of which had to do with re-reading instructions and making mistakes and figuring out what I did wrong.I like the layout of the buttons and the back light is pretty bright; the color is red, but it would have been nice if it was a shade of blue or just plain white.A good thing about this remote is that all your commands and programming is stored on a memory chip. If your batteries die, according to the manufacturer, you can come back months later to insert new batteries and the programming will still be in the remote. In real world terms, this means if you run out of batteries or use rechargeables, you have more than enough time to replace the batteries in the unit without losing all your hard earned programming.This remote is quite deep in features, and I may never get to the point where I used all of them, but it's good to know that they're there in case I need them. I did use one of the more ""advanced"" functions by mapping all of my devices to the TV volume controls. Now, no matter if I use the DVD, Roku, or VCR, the volume controls are linked to the TV functions.However, it should be pointed out that programming macros or steps for customized features doesn't always work. I found out that while doing a macro for turning on various components, it was all but impossible because the remote has no way if knowing where the last input setting was on the TV. Some TVs have dedicated buttons for video 1, video 2, etc., but if your TV needs to screen through button presses, you're out of luck with the WR7.It takes some work to program this thing and YMMV as to how quick, easy, and successful you are in getting the expected results. Some devices may not work with this remote, but using the learning mode or scan function takes care of most of these worries. There are probably instances where this remote will not work on some electronics; but for 20 bucks, it seems to handle most situations very well. It should be pointed out that even the most expensive universal remotes have programming issues.Overall this device doesn't get a perfect 5-star because the steps in programming may turn off some people and it isn't as easy as the company leads on. But if you've programmed universal remotes before, don't mind spending a bit of time learning how to program this unit, or are OK with carefully following instructions, for about $20, this remote is really worth it.",4.0,Great if you follow the instructions and have patience,1383782400,"11 7, 2013"

I had some questions so I decided to call both Logitech and URC. I called Logitech first, was placed on hold for about 15 minutes, answered by a woman who said, ""I don't know much about the Harmony remotes, let me transfer you."" After another 10 minutes on hold I hung up. Highly irritated, I called URC. [WARNING: What follows is virtually unbelievable, but, I swear that it is true!]Before the second ring, a LIVE person answered the phone, understood the reason for my call, and transferred me to Kevin, who answered IMMEDIATELY. Kevin was knowledgeable and answered my questions efficiently - total phone time, maybe 3 minutes. Absolutely unbelievable - clearly an aberration in the current world of ""customer service."" Needless to say, I immediately pressed the Amazon ""Buy"" button.(Now, Amazon's turn! I'm a Prime member so I was expecting 2nd day delivery. Nope, showed up the next day - thanks, Amazon!)Back to the remote - I have a simple setup: a) Vizio e472vl TV, b) Liteon DVD, c) Panasonic VCR (&lt;-yep, no typo!), d) DirecTV receiver/DVR, e) and a Bose Wave radio.The remote can be programmed several ways: by utilizing its built-in codes (and, three methods to do this), by entering the component's 3 digit IR code, or by ""learning"" from the old remote. The instructions are clearly written, easy to follow and contain many 3 digit codes for many components.In my case, the 3 digit code for the DirecTV receiver/DVR was in the list, so, following the instructions for ""Three-Digit Code Entry Method,"" I programmed it (mostly, more later) very easily. Likewise, the Panasonic VCR programmed easily and automagically with the 3 digit code.THe Vizio codes in the manual did not work for me so I followed the instructions for the ""Quick Setup Method"" and had the TV programmed (again, mostly) in about 15 seconds.The Liteon DVD and the Bose were programmed using the ""Learning Method."" I had trouble with this aspect, and, for the life of me could not get the WR7 to ""learn."" I looked through the Amazon reviews for clues as to what I was doing wrong, but could find nothing - including complaints about the learning function, which suggested that I was the problem!Once again I called URC, once again the phone was answered immediately and once again I was talking (oddly enough!) to Kevin! (We now have ""repeatability"" on URC's CUSTOMER SERVICE so, as far as I am concerned, its the real deal and reason enough to do business with them.) And, sure enough the issue was mine!In case anyone else has trouble, here is what I was doing wrong. Following the manual directions for ""Learning Mode,"" first, on the WR7, press the Component button (that you wish to control) plus the ENT button at the same time for about 2 seconds until the Component button lights up. Then, on the WR7, press the button that you want to program and IMMEDIATELY RELEASE, then press and HOLD the appropriate button on the old remote until the WR7 blinks twice, indicating receipt of the code. I was pressing the button on the WR7 too long - so, press and immediately release and you'll be good to go. Follow the instructions in the manual with this in mind. Once I did it right, the ""learning"" process was a snap.Now, back to the TV and DirecTV controller - the pre-programmed codes set up most of the functionality on the WR7 but not all. Adding the missing functions was as easy as adding them through the ""Learning Mode.""I know that this review is ""wordy"" but I hope that it conveys my experience with URC which is the most pleasant that I've had in many years. The fact that their controller works flawlessly and is priced fairly is simply ""icing on the cake"" - URC is my only future choice for remotes and recommendations to people for remotes.Best of luck with yours!",5.0,Wonderful Product - Even Better Customer Service,1315440000,"09 8, 2011"

A1I4CKGOC84GGO,B001KC08A4,Gary H. Arrington,"[3, 3]","My Harmony remote buttons were getting hard to press so I decided to replace it with the WR7. The WR7 had the codes needed for my Sony TV and for my DirectTV DVR, but not for my Panasonic DVD\surround sound mini system.This is not much of a problem since the WR7 is a learning remote and apparently has plenty of memory. I'm pretty much a ""gadget"" guy, but I've got to tell you I was stumped trying to get the remote into learning mode. You must press the Enter key and the component key together. Now, the diagram of the remote in the instruction manual identifies many keys, but for some strange reason they failed to specifically point out the ""enter"" key. It's not the same as the ""select"" key. After doing a search on the internet, I learned that this seems to be a common problem among users. The ""enter"" key is the key on the numeric keypad directly below the ""9"" key...strange!Once I got through slapping my head, the WR7 learned all the commands quickly from my Panasonic remote.I then began programming a few macros and ran into a couple of problems...first, I wanted to turn on everything in my system and leave the remote set to ""talk"" to my DirectTV receiver. Apparently, the last part is not possible with this remote. Even though I programmed the ""cab/sat"" button as the last step in the macro, the remote will always default to whatever component button was last pressed before running the macro. This is not a major problem, but irritating. So, when I turn on the system, the ""TV"" component may be active instead of the ""cab/sat"" button, requiring me to manually set the remote to the correct component.The second problem is a little more critical for anyone that's using this remote to control more than just a basic system. This remote does not support any kind of discreet codes. This is not too much of a problem with power on and off (though it would be nice) but it's a major problem if your TV or amp has a handful of inputs and you need to jump directly to the correct one. For instance, if you're watching TV and want to switch to a DVD, you want the remote to send a discreet command that selects the DVD input on the TV.There is a work-around to this last problem if you're replacing an old remote that had these discreet codes installed. You can ""learn"" the discreet codes from your old remote onto an unused component, then include it in your macro. But if you don't have a remote with discreet codes you're out of luck with this remote. Fortunately, the old Harmony had these codes that I could teach to the WR7.Overall, I like the remote, but it would really not have been adequate for my use if I hadn't had the ability to learn the discreet commands. It's a little large for the hand and the volume buttons (good punch through feature) require you to move your hand up the remote to reach them. It has a good backlight and the buttons have a nice surface and feel when you press them.",3.0,"Good remote, but missing some important features",1311811200,"07 28, 2011"

I had moderate luck with punching in the 3-number codes, though in each case I had to add a couple buttons to the remote using the ""learning"" function.And then 3 devices (Roku and the two switches) I had to teach the remote every single button (by the way, using the ""learning"" function, I was able to consolidate those three devices under a single ""device"" on the remote, leaving me two open devices if I should decide to add something to my system).They work perfectly, with no need to go to the old remotes for any functionality.And, now that it is done, anyone in the house can use it intuitively.But it took time--an hour of studying before I began and nearly three hours of setup.There are limitations.

AKT0Y6J9AK469,B001KC08A4,"GumbyTheCat ""Gumby""","[1, 1]","I've had this remote for several months now, and it is no doubt the best universal remote I have ever owned. Yeah, it would be nice if it had a touch screen or I could plug it into my computer and download codes. But for under twenty dollars (I got mine for 12!) I'm reasonably sure you'd be hard-pressed to find a better (or even comparable) remote.First I'll briefly mention the button layout, which is tidy and logical. There's about 50 buttons, but the remote is somewhat large so the buttons are larger and have more room around them than other universal remotes. In other words, it doesn't have that ""crowded"" look or feel. The ""Light"" button is appropriately placed by itself at the bottom of the remote, and the lit-up remote is very attractive and easy to read no matter how dark it is. A cool feature about the light - it turns off after a few minutes, so if the remote slips between the couch cushions with the backlight on, it will turn off and save the battery.Battery life is impressive... I've had this for at least eight months and I have yet to change the two AA batteries that came with it. With its non-volatile memory, it has never ""forgotten"" a command over time.A nice feature is separate on and off switches. Not all electronics components have toggle-type power on/off (i.e. the same remote code for both on and off). Mine do, though, so what I did was program the ""On"" button to control on/off for my entire system, and programmed the ""Off"" button to power off the specific device the remote is currently set to operate.The instruction manual is extremely well-written, and steps you through every programming or other operation in clear, concise fashion.The ""Learning"" function makes ""stealing"" codes from other remotes a breeze. I decided to program my entire home theater setup (Yamaha RX-V367BL 5.1 Channel 500 Watt AV Receiver, Curtis LCD HDTV and Insignia WiFi streaming Blu-ray player) using the learning function as opposed to the other methods (Quick Setup, Three-Digit Code Entry, and Auto-Search). I'm glad I did it that way, because the learning process is absolutely accurate and painless. I had all the home theater functions I wanted programmed into the remote within 20 minutes, and it only took that long because it was my first time using a learning remote and so I was therefore very deliberate in my actions. Later on, I even set the 7th device to operate my window unit air conditioner, just for the heck of it, after seeing a reviewer here say he did the same thing.Programming the Macro buttons with multiple commands is easy as well. Macro is a great way to switch your TV to the appropriate video mode, switch to DVD mode on the remote, etc. with the press of one button.Really, you cannot go wrong buying this remote, especially given the amazing low price.

The first is my old ReplayTV DVR (yeah, yeah. HD DVR. One of these days).  I looked through the instructions, and I don't think the word DVR or PVR is mentioned - as if the remote was built in 1995.  Since the WR7 is also a learning remote I quickly mapped the AUX button to handle my DVR.I have some fine tuning to do.  Some device buttons turn the device on while others do nothing but allow you to use the POWER button.  But generally speaking, it's doing everything I wanted it to do - replicate all the buttons from my four remotes.Oh, and twice in a week I woke up and found my Harmony 650 dead.  Apparently, if you don't set it down exactly right it will drain its batteries.",4.0,An excellent low-price choice,1383004800,"10 29, 2013"

I was advised that the base level remotes that they had that would do that were the RF 10 and RF 20.

The small interaction I had with customer service, and they really encourage contacting  them in the manual, was very good.

A2WUN1071K8NHS,B001KC08A4,Humble Patriot,"[0, 0]","This review is for the URC WR7 Universal Remote:PROS:BacklitIntuitive LayoutUp to Seven ComponentsProgrammableCONS:Lacks Expected ButtonsSome Pre-programmed Functions Don't WorkProgramabilityI have the Logitech Harmony 300, but don't like it because the buttons are small, not backlit, and difficult to find in the dark when watching late-night TV or movies. I tried both the Harmony 600 and 650, but had significant quality control issues with each.  The URC WR7 seemed like the perfect replacement for the Harmony 300, particularly at the reasonable price available on Amazon (a fraction of the cost of the Logitech remotes).  Its buttons are large, backlit and visible in the dark, which is a real plus.  I can use the codes in the back of the instruction manual to find my brand of component and experiment to see which code will program the remote for my particular component, or I can use the ""learning"" function to directly program each button on the remote, employing the IR transmitter on the original remotes that came with my A/V components.The advantage that the Logitech remotes have over the URC WR7 is that you can connect the Harmony remotes to your computer's USB port, bring up the Logitech website, enter the model number of each of your components, and have your computer directly program all of its functions.  Unfortunately, there is no computer interface or USB connectability for the WR7, and one must use the traditional method of entering numerical codes (found in the back of the WR7 manual) into its keypad to ""discover"" the proper code for one's component.  I say ""discover"" because many brands like SONY, Technics and others have multiple codes that one must try before finding the correct one. Sometimes, even when finding the correct code, one discovers that there are buttons on the component's original remote that are not on the WR7.  An example of this is the ""list"" button on the Scientific Atlanta cable box remote that allows me to directly access the menu for recorded programs on my Comcast DVR service; this button is included on the Harmony 300 and other models, but is not on the WR7 (there are a couple other missing buttons as well).  If I want that function in a button, I can program it on any WR7 button I choose under the WR7's Satellite/Cable selection, but doing so requires me to re-program all of the other buttons for that particular component, because individually programming ANY function button will remove the entire pre-programming for a particular component if I previously used the manual's numerical code to program the component on the keypad.Another limitation is that, even when one manually enters the proper numerical program code for a particular component, sometimes not all of the functions work.  It is as if they simply left them out or forgot about them.  For example, I have the SONY BDP-S570 3D Blu-Ray player; even when entering the proper numerical code into the WR7, not all of the function buttons work.  Because there is no computer interface, the remote's firmware cannot be updated and the only way around it is to manually program all the buttons if I want to operate all the functions on the SONY.  Again, if  one has patience it isn't a problem, but connectability like that available from Logitech would have been nice.Overall, this is a good remote for consolidating up to seven remotes and being able to see what you're doing when watching TV or movies in a darkened room. Its limitations are no computer interface and a lack of buttons found on other products such as the Logitech Harmony line.  If you have the patience and are willing to program your own buttons, it is a very good option and only a fraction of the price of Logitech's backlit products.  I'll be keeping it for now.",3.0,"URC WR7 is a good universal remote, but is limited",1345852800,"08 25, 2012"

There is only one device that, so far, I've not been able to get the remote to recognize but my TV, cable box, stereo, and one of my two blu-ray players are working from this remote just fine.One problem I had with other remotes was the failure to have buttons that performed all the functions I use. For example, when watching cable TV if I hit the guide button twice I get a list of the shows for the selected channel listed by time. The cable box's remote has next/prev day buttons which will move to the next/previous day. This remote actually has two buttons programmed to do this when I added my cable box. They are not intuitive as next day is the 'play' button in the DVD control section and prev day is the stop button, but they ARE there... I don't have to use two of the four 'favorite' buttons.One minor flaw. The remote has the ability to tie two or more devices to the power on/off buttons. This allows for one button press to turn on the TV/cable/stereo for example. However, once you do that, I could find no way to turn on one of the other devices. I set up the remote to turn on my TV and cable box. But when I press the DVD button and then press the power button, it still controls the TV/cable box duo. No way to turn on the DVD.

I understand that there may be something about the Roku that makes it hard to program (possibly distance held from WR7) but what made it so difficult was that the WR7 kept giving me the signal that it had learned a Roku button so I would move through the rest of the buttons only to find out that it only had only learned one or two (or none) when finished.  Another thing is that sometimes a device select button needs to be pushed several time before it will work.  This is fairly uncommon and only happens maybe one in twenty times, but when it does it has to be pushed several times before it will light.  All in all, though, this is the best remote I have owned and I would it again.",4.0,Well designed universal remote control,1388707200,"01 3, 2014"

I found (by methodical trial and error) that I can't have certain DVR commands (stop, channel up/down) in a macro.  I found that you do NOT have to put in a device code to program a 'favorite' button once the device is programmed.

A640CC830XA,B001KC08A4,JMSamler,"[0, 0]","I saw several reviews in here that state the WR7 won't work with the Dish Network ViP722k receiver.  Let me quell those notions and state it DOES WORK, BUT not the way you might think.  Let me explain.When I first did the programing for my components, I was able to get the ViP722k to respond to all commands with the WR7 EXCEPT the WR7 would not turn it on and off.  I deleted everything I had done on the WR7 and started again from square one, not satisfied that there should be any reason it won't work.  I reprogrammed the ViP722k using the &#34;Quick Set Up&#34; function and within a few keys of the remote, the ViP722k shut off, as it's supposed to.  HOWEVER, if you are expecting, as you should, the On button on the WR7 to turn it on and off, you would be wrong, it doesn't work, BUT the System Off button DOES WORK to turn the ViP722k on and off.  Also, make sure the ViP722k is set to &#34;1&#34; in the system settings for remote 1, which is the remote I was programming.  From what I have read, remote 2 for the 2nd tv can NOT be programmed by any universal remote (it uses UHF), but I am only interested in remote 1 as it is my primary tv.My setup:LG 47LS4500 - set up using &#34;Quick Set Up&#34; function - works perfectPanasonic DVD player (older) - set up using &#34;Quick Set Up&#34; function - works perfectYamaha RX-V473 AV receiver - none of the codes worked and would not set up using &#34;Quick Set Up&#34; function.  Used the &#34;learning mode&#34; and programmed each function individually that I need - works perfectDish Network ViP722k - already detailed above (all functions of the DVR work too when using &#34;Quick Set Up&#34; function)I used the &#34;system off&#34; button to turn my receiver, tv, and dish on and off together using the macro total system on/off and left the &#34;on&#34; button to control each component individually on/off (we primarily watch TV/DVR).  The Yamaha is the sole source of sound for all viewing methods, also set up with the WR7.The reasons I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 are:1.  The confusion around setting it up to work with the ViP722k2.  Sometimes the buttons need more than 1 press to work, I most often find this with the ViP722k, but it isn't a big deal, it still works very well.What I like most about the WR7:1.  Ease of use and setup.  Once you get used to the setup procedures, they really are very simple and I would consider my technical level to be medium.2.  Quality - WR7 has a very nice feel to it and seems well made.3.  Price - are you kidding?  For $20, it's a STEAL, I feel for those spending hundreds of dollars on a Harmony.  What a waste.Bottom line, this remote is very worth it.  The macros are my favorite feature, being able to turn more than 1 component on and off with the 1 button is awesome.  Total volume and channel control is awesome too.I hope this review helps those who are struggling to make this remote work with the ViP722k.

Excellent customer service.To learn IR codes [ENT] button is used(different from ""Select"" button located between the arrows). However, it is small and located in numerical group under ""9"" button. Picture in the manual that describes buttons has no noticeable label for [ENT] button. I do feel somewhat stupid but I couldn't find it until I called customer service (no wait time, answered my question (""But it has no ENT button!"") almost before I asked it). I also asked some of the coworkers to try and find it, they all pointed to SEL and nobody found ENT in several minutes.Remote had built-in support for 4 components I had (2 TVs, cable box and VCR; programmed using 3-digit code) and codes for one (Haier DVD player) had to be learned from original remote.Keep in mind that when trying different codes for your device even when you find one that powers it off it may not be the one you need. If you see not all keys work correctly try next code for this vendor.From manual it seems that you cannot program remote to control (for example) TV via CD button using 3-digit code.

A1BR58DZHYEO6Z,B001KC08A4,John Duval,"[1, 1]","It is challenging to find a universal remote that is as intuitive, useable in the dark by feel alone, and has a button for all the essential controls. I have had two Harmonies, for which I always needed a flashlite and magnifying glass to use, not to mention days to set up. The system has never seemed as reliable or quick as with the WR7.My Tivo remote is hands down my favorite remote, but it was worn out and I wanted a cheaper replacement. The WR7 is half the cost. Mostly I use the TV and Tivo alone, but when watching Blu-ray I turned on the whole A/V kit using the Harmony to manage everything. So what the heck, I set up the WR7 to run the whole system in about an hour, the complex macros are more reliable, and everything is much more responsive.I like the way the separate device buttons lite up so you know right away if you are in the right mode and controling the right device. As usual, there are a few functions that don't quite have a home, like eject and aspect ratio/zoom. One great feature that compensates well is where you can program any button to start a macro after holding for two seconds. For example: I learned eject to an unused device mode, then programed a macro in DVD mode to access the hidden eject button after holding stop for two seconds. I have each device button run a setup macro after holding for two seconds as well.The only negatives I see over a Harmony is that the WR7 does not keep track of device states, and Harmony gives access to many IR codes that even OEM remotes don't have. So with WR7 you have to return the system to a known state before runing a different setup routine. I used the Harmony to teach it separate on and off commands and direct port select codes to side step this issue, and the WR7 still does a better job.If I could ask for one change, it would be that the remote would switch to my default device mode any time I hit the power button, or after so many hours unused, so my wife won't get upset about the remote not working.So what is the ultimate remote?

It controls the TV we watch some over the air broadcasts on the network channels via a simple antenna, Surround sound receiver, DVD player, and VCR (rarely used these days)  Using the programmable macro function, I have set up each of the component buttons to turn on all devices and swap to the correct inputs with the touch of one button.For example I press my TV button, turns on TV sets input to GAME input, turns on receiver sets input to DTV/Cable, turns on Xbox and everything is set to go, the middle arrow buttons on the remote perfectly control the menus in xbox 360 so clicking and scrolling through the games/apps is perfect...even more convenient than the xbox controller.Likewise I press the DVD button...everything turns on and the DVD player is set to go with full control on the remote.One tip, when programming a macro for one button control....insert a pause at the beginning.  This allows you to manually switch between your components in the remote if you simply want to, but the macro will only activate if you hold the button for two seconds.It really replaces my harmony one remote completely...if you have a little patience you can set it up to have one button control your viewing activities.There were a couple of buttons on my receiver, that this remote was able to 'learn'For less than $25 this remote is an absolute steal.

I was able to set this up to control my TV, cable box, roku, and even a PC attached to my machine (with a wireless usb pc remote control mouse purchased separately).  My complaint though, is that a couple of buttons are already not functioning, after only a few months.  One of those is one of the device buttons, for the DVD device, where I had programmed the Roku.  So I moved that to the Aud decive button, and now I have a 6 component remote.  More annoying was the up channel button now isn't working.  OK, so I reprogrammed the fav button just above that to act as a channel up.  Hard to give more than 3 stars though, given these issues, though the design and features are nice.  It also was some trouble to program for the Roku; it would be much better if there were a preset for this.  Since I have the Roku 2 XS, which ships with a bluetooth remote, I had to purchase the basic remote from Roku just to have something to program this with.Aside from that, no real complaints.  Some of the buttons are a little tough to read in lower light, basically black buttons with greyish text.  But the back light button takes care of that, lighting up that text in bright red.

This remote will be used mainly in the bedroom, which has a TV, DVD changer, & DVD/VCR combo.  I also have aLogitech Harmony One Universal Remotein the living room, so I'll be comparing these 2 units to each other.Pros:-->  Soft, rubber buttons more comfortable to press as opposed to Harmony One's cheap-feeling, plastic buttons (my personal preference).-->  No PC needed to program the unit.  This could be a pro or a con, depending on your point-of-view.  If you needto perform simple programming on your remote, it's so much more convenient to use the code entering/searchfunctions or the learning function on this unit than it is to hook up a remote to your PC.-->  Punch-through function -- control DVD, Blu-Ray functions while also controlling the volume on your TV.-->  Uses AA batteries rather than an internal battery that needs to be charged on a cradle.  I have enoughchargers, cradles, power cords for my other electronic gizmos.  This just saves space and reduces clutter.-->  Every single button has a glowing red backlight.  Very cool.-->  Very inexpensive.Cons:-->  The volume and channel up/down buttons are to high up on the remote.  Those are the most used functions so theyshould be placed near the middle (or lower middle) where your thumb would be when holding it with one hand.-->  3 of my devices' codes were not found in the code book provided by the manufacturer.  So I had to manuallyprogram each button.  This was a bit time-consuming at first, but by the time I got to the third device, I foundit actually went quite quickly.  Only problem was that a few of the buttons had to be re-programmed 3-4 times towork for some reason.-->  I can't get it to work with my Logitech PS3 adapter (even when using the Harmony One to program it remote-to-remote.  Maybe because the adapter is only compatible with Logitech remotes?  I'll be calling UniversalRemote for more info on that.  I know there are other PS3 adapters compatible with this remote, but I alreadyown the Logitech one.-->  The WR7 is a bit bulky and not as ergonomically correct as the Harmony One (which feels very comfortable in my hand).Overall, a great remote for the price, and in many ways superior to the Harmony One which costs almost ten times as much.  If you need/like detailed PC customization of your remote's functions (such as PS3 control, an Activities function, or an LCD touchscreen w/logos etc.), then the Harmony One or some other high-end remote is the way to go.  But if all you need is a remote to simply control your TV, DVD, VCR, or audio system and do it well, than save your money and get the WR7 by Universal Remote.

I had three other ""universal"" remotes at home -- two Sonys that came with DVD players and one $10 generic universal remote -- and none of them worked on the Sanyo. So I was leery that this one would work with it so that's why I bought from Amazon -- it has a great return policy. And it worked.If you've got the real remotes, this probably is easier to use because it gives you numerous methods of programming the remote, one of which is just pointing the real remotes at it and having it absorb the commands. I didn't have that option. There is an exhaustive list of brands in the manual, each with multiple corresponding numbers that you type into the remote to see if they work. Some of the numbers partially work so you'll want to try inputting them all for the brand of TV/DVD player/VCR/etc. that you're trying to program to find which number contains the most commands that automatically transfer over to the universal remote.Another great feature is that even if not all of the commands transfer over with the above method, you can program individual buttons to do specific actions. So, for instance, the ""next"" button to skip chapters on the DVD player worked but the fast forward and rewind buttons didn't. (On the real remote, you'd ""hold"" the next button to have it scan forward but that part didn't transfer.) So there are two sets of arrow buttons. One set automatically replicated the next and back buttons, and I programmed the others to scan. Piece of cake.Another nice feature is there is a universal on and a universal off button so that you can click a single button and both the TV and DVD player will turn on or off, very handy when watching in bed and you want to turn it all off to go to sleep.NEGATIVE: We've had this for 3 months as of this writing and one day it ""forgot"" some of the buttons. The batteries were fine and had not been taken out. As you can see from the above, it can be a complicated process to program the remote and you've got to remember where you put the manual because it's not something you can do without it.

A1IJI6LBORTQXJ,B001KC08A4,"Master Angelus ""Slasher Troll""","[0, 0]","For this remote to be four years old, most of its codes are surprisingly up to date. The only thing I couldn't program by code was my first-generation Roku XD. But I learned all 8 keys on the remote so it was no problem. I did notice that when using the Learning function, the light will blink twice, indicating that it learned my key but then later nothing will happen when I press it. This may be either a memory problem or a design flaw in the keys, but I found that if I used Learning to map the key a second time it worked fine. My parents have the R6 remote, so I'm pretty familiar with the layout and the feel of the remote. This one has moved a few of the buttons, but not so much that it's frustrating to use. The design is definitely something different with this remote. The R6 remote has a fairly uniform shell, but this is contoured. Think Klingon Bird of Prey. It has a very thick base and then has a long, slender ""neck"" before reaching the end. I don't know why they did this. The front of the remote is the same width as always, and there are keys all the way down the front. Maybe they needed more room in the caboose for the backlighting. I have big hands and do sometimes find it hard to hold the remote and use it with fingers on the same hand. I love the new backlighting feature. If you just hit the key and nothing else, the remote stays lit for about 15 seconds. But if you hit the light key and start pressing, it will stay lit until you are done. Also, the light can be toggled off and on with multiple key presses. The remote does have a nice, solid feel to it. The buttons have a soft-press feel like an expensive keyboard. No click-click cheap plastic here. The center Select button feels a little stiff and I sometimes have to press it more than once to register a press, but I think that will loosen up with time. You can even reassign device keys if you have more than one of anything. It's not in the book, but I found it with a little web-searching. This remote works for everything I own. My equipment:42"" LG Plasma TVDish Network DVR ReceiverSamsung Blu-Ray PlayerPioneer Region-Free DVD PlayerToshiba DVD RecorderRoku XD (first Gen.)Philips Sound BarMost of the codes would handle the major functions of each device. You may have to try multiple codes to get all of your keys to work. For me, I just used the first code that worked and then learned a few special keys per device. My only regret is that it is four years old and I wasn't using it all along. Hopefully, URC will make a new remote as close to this as possible, or find a way to update the codes in this one. Bottom line: buy this if you have more than 4 remotes cluttering your space. This is the best budget remote I've found in the last year. I've tried half a dozen and returned them all or given them away. It may take a little time to get your setup programmed just right, but it's worth it in the long-run.Update 5/15/14: Whatever was wrong with the Select button has spread and several of the buttons around it have have also  stopped working over the course of a year.

I was looking into the Harmony remotes, but they were so ridiculously overpriced it wasn't even worth it.  I have a wide variety of electronics: my cable box, blu-ray player, surround sound system, an old VCR, my Xbox 360, and my LCD TV.  Everything is connected in various ways to various inputs with specific patterns needed to have one item have both picture and sound.  I knew the process ok, but my girlfriend was lost.Personally, I didn't think a $20 remote could handle everything I needed.  I remember my previous universal remote from about 10 years ago: needed lots of codes, and most of the stuff I had didn't even have codes listed.  Well, I was greatly mistaken... this thing took care of what I needed, and more.  Not only did it replace every single remote I have, without any loss of functionality, but it simplified the whole process... with the push of just one button, the blu-ray player turns on, the stereo turns on and switches to the correct input, and the TV turns on and switches to the correct input.  Same thing with the Xbox, and the VCR.  When I'm finished, push that same button again, and it shuts everything off.  The only problem I had to add one more button push to switch the inputs back to my cable... not a big deal at all.Nothing about this item is bad... the backlighting is great, it feels nice in your hand, the buttons are soft and squishy.  It feels well made.  The learning function makes sure you'll never be without a needed command.  The only hard part is remembering where you programmed all those special commands to!Buy this product, you absolutely will not be disappointed!Edit: I've figured out how to set the macro function so you can turn on all components at once by holding down a specific button.  The directions aren't too clear on it.  Hold down the component button you want and the mute button at the same time.  Press pause twice.  Then do the programing, and hit the channel up button at the end.  Prior to this, I was holding the power on button thinking that would do it, and instead only one program would stay.  Pressing power on for any device would always pull up the last program I put in.  The manufacturer even thought so far into it that they let you add pauses in the programing, to allow the device time to turn on and initialize, before the remote sends out its next command.The way I have my remote set up now:  Power on is unprogrammed.  I use it only for turning on individual devices.  Power off is programed to turn on/off my TV and cable box, since I use this function more than anything else.  If you hold down CD, I have it programmed to turn on my receiver and switch to mp3 player input.  VCR turns the VCR on and switches the TV to the right input.  DVD turns on the DVD player, turns on the receiver and switches to DVD input, and turns the TV to the right input.  And AUX turns on my Xbox, switches the receiver to the right input, and switches the TV to the right input.  The push through function let me set up the volume control for all the devices properly... the VCR and cable box have the TV volume, and the Xbox and DVD player have the receiver volume.The only limitation I've run in to is mainly the fault of my TV and not the remote.  My TV takes about 30 seconds to turn on, so I can't program in anything with the TV unless it's already on.  Also, my TV doesn't have a remote function to tune to a specific input, only an input button.  So programing in tuning to a certain input can only be like 5 input button pushes.  There's no way to return it to normal except by pushing the input button until it's correct.",5.0,Excellent Product!,1278115200,"07 3, 2010"

Out of the box, the remote appears well-made and the buttons have a nice feel: soft enough to be comfortable yet firm enough to avoid accidental inputs. The instruction manual is clear and concise with the consumer in mind.A nice function I haven't seen before is the ability to automatically identify the device to control and program the remote accordingly. For example, my LG TV, Xbox 360 and Onkyo receiver were identified in this manner by a few prescribed button presses - no looking up and guessing at codes in tables! For the cheap-o VCR/DVD combo, the WR7 showed off another great utility in its learning feature. Pointing the WR7 at the original remote, I was able to easily map the desired buttons to my liking on the new control.I found the punch-through and macro programming features of the WR7 to be surprisingly capable. Punch-throughs allow volume or channel commands to control a designated device when the remote is set to control another. For example, I have the volume controls always redirect to the receiver. Macro controls allow a programmable sequence of button presses - with delays if necessary - to be executed by a single press. There are a total of 11 macro-capable buttons including the 7 device and 4 color buttons. Macros can be programmed to turn devices on/off and switch inputs or cycle through favorite channels with the push of a button.After a couple of weeks of use, the WR7 has become an essential part of my entertainment center.

It's ergonomically designed, feels really comfortable in your hand and looks really sexy and expensive (to me, anyway). Also, the illumination feature, which lights every button is really neat.  The remote can also be programmed with macros to automatically perform a range of functions, across components. These macros can even be programmed on the component buttons. So, for example, every press of the DVD button can change the input of your TV, as well as your A/V receiver, to the inputs for the Blu-ray/DVD player. This can be quite handy, especially for quickly switching between sources, especially if using an A/V receiver.Component buttons, by the way, can be programmed - via learning - for any component. So, for example, you can program your VCR button for your media streamer (once you teach the remote codes of your media streamer's remote to the VCR buttons on the remote).On the subject of learning, however, this is where I think the remote can do better (although this is very dependent on your equipment). In my case, I use all 7 components. Unfortunately, however, only the TV's codes were automatically setup by the remote. I had to teach it codes for every other component; and that's where I have my issue. It's capacity for learning is limited. Of course, I would have been using approximately 15 buttons per component, so that's like 90 codes. I recognize that most people would not need this amount of learning, so the remote will probably be perfect for most. Some remotes, like the Sony VL-600 (see my review) is much better at this, having seemingly unlimited capacity for learning. I have to say, I own 4 models of URC remotes, and two of Sony, and have never encountered a capacity issue with either of the Sony's, but have with 3 of the models of URC. The Sony's are setup for the same zones as the corresponding URC, in each case, requiring learning for the same amount of components. So, the Sony's are better at learning.Overall, though, I'd say I love this remote... that's the truth.  It just feels good.

I needed a universal remote to support 6 devices and was just not in to paying over $100 for the 6-device Harmony remote.  Given the price, I kept my expectations at ""cautiously optimistic"".  My old remote worked flawlessly with minimal programming effort and I knew at the lower price, this one most likely would not be the same.  This remote definitely takes more effort to program, but once programmed worked just as well for me and can still hold one more device.  Like some other more critical reviews, I found that none of the quick setup  methods (quick setup, 3 code entry, auto-search) worked for 5 of my 6 devices.  It only worked on the oldest device that is 8 years old and even that one required some additional teaching.  I ended up programming the remote using the learning feature.  This task went fairly quickly for me because I was able to have it learn from the old remote for four of the devices but it still took close to an hour to program every key for every device. I have no idea how a person could get this to work properly if the original remote was lost because the codes in the book seem outdated.  It did work for me and just took patience.  The programming would be much faster and easier if the remote had USB connectivity for programming similar to the Harmony but I'm sure that feature comes with a price.  Bottom line:  If you want an affordable remote that, with a little effort, can be programmed to work with almost any component, then this WR7 is the way to go.

More than five years, probably closer to 8.  It's been with me through several generations of TV, and 2 AV receivers.  I just clicked a new one into my shopping cart, because I'd be mighty sad if this one broke.I like my home theater, love movies, big surround-sound fan.  I keep an eye on the universal remotes because like so many of us, I am always on the upgrade trail.  But as many of us gadget loving guys learn, &#34;Upgrades&#34; are NOT always improvements.Some of the features I'm very fond of:I like, and use, the channel and volume &#34;Punch-through&#34; so that no matter what device I'm controlling at the moment, Channel commands go to my cable box, and volume commands go to the amp.  I suppose that is a common feature these days, but would never buy a remote without it.Nice back-lighting on the keys, and it's red so it won't blow out your night vision.Macros.  Gotta love the macros.  I've used quite a few over the years.  I'm about to add another (thanks to someone elses review here) I like to listen to a particular music channel while I sleep.  A one-touch macro will give me that channel, drop the volume, set a sleep timer, and kill the screen for me.And of course the learning function.  I know, it's not unique or anything, but I find it essential when I don't agree with a pre-programmed layout, or stubborn device control.I realize this isn't god's gift to remote control heaven, but it's well built, priced right, looks good, feels good, works good, and has all the really important features, all at a good price.  Hard to beat that combination.  I guess THAT'S why it's still being sold.  I just wanted to give a respectful nod to a product that has served me well under hard use, for a very long time.  I've come to appreciate that more and more lately, as we seem to be drowning in a sea of planned obsolescence.  I think it's important the the products we buy should LAST for a while.

I have a Sony tv and a Comcast/Pace cable adapter; I have the cable going directly into the tv tuner input for high definition channels, and the cable adapter output is fed into another device that converts RF to VGA which is then fed into the PC input on the TV.  Sound complicated?  It is, but this remote made this setup much easier to manage switching between using the tv's tuner and the cable adapter's tuner.  My favorite feature is that the device selection buttons are also programmable to send commands to the tv.  I programmed those buttons to switch the input source on the tv, so by pressing just one button on the remote, I can switch the remote keys to work with a particular device AND change the input on the tv to use either the tv tuner or cable adapter as its input source.  The IR signal coming from the remote seems very strong.  The separate backlight button is a nice feature.  Using the learning feature is very easy to do.  No separate sleep timer button on the remote, but I programmed one of the favorites buttons as a sleep timer button.  It is a bit big and heavy, but not enough to be a problem.Thought I would update my review after 2 weeks of ownership:  I also own a Logitech Harmony One remote, which I like a lot but my wife hates.  The Harmony One wins on build quality and color touch screen (cool factor?). The URC-WR7 is functionally very similar.  The Harmony One costs close to $200, and the WRC is about $20.

A1HJTRVPEVVTVH,B001KC08A4,One-Shot Scot,"[33, 35]","The Universal WR7 is an upgrade from my Universal R7. I was very happy with the R7, but it had no three-digit code for my OPPO DVD player and the R7 was unable to learn the commands from the remote to my Roku digital video player. The WR7 has the OPPO DVD player code and it was also able to learn the Roku commands.Increased functionality and ease of programming can be realized with both the R7 the WR7 remotes by using an undocumented programming method. There is no problem entering TV codes into the TV button, DVD codes into the DVD button etc. However, it you have more than one DVD player, VCR or other component, programming the Universal remote control can be challenging. The WR7 may refuse to learn remote control functions from device categories that do not match the category of the function key being programmed.The following example shows how to enter a DVD code into a non-DVD button, but the same basic procedure can be used for any other component code that does not match the category of the button to which it is being assigned. This procedure can also be incorporated into other programming methods described in the owner's manual. The key to success is step 2.1. Press the non-DVD component button (TV, VCR, SAT/CABLE, AUX, AUD or CD) that you want to program with a DVD code and the SEL button at the same time and hold both buttons down until the component button LED light turns on. Release the buttons.2. Press the DVD component button. This undocumented step tells the R7 and WR7 remotes that the next three digits will be a DVD code. (If you were entering a VCR code into a non-VCR component button, you would press the VCR button before entering the code. The same method would apply when programming a TV, SAT/CABLE or CD code into non-matching component buttons.) This is a variation of ""punch through"" programming for sound and channels.3. Enter the three-digit DVD code and press the lighted component button (it will blink three times) and save the code. You can also try several different codes as outlined in the ""Three-Digit Code Entry Method"" or the ""Auto Search Method"" in the owner's manual, before saving the code. Any missing functions can be learned from the original remote control.Some functions assigned by the three-digit method, such as zoom or slow motion keys that must be held down to activate cycling, may not work exactly like the those of the original remote control. Re-learning these commands from the original remote may resolve these problems.The Universal R7 is a great value in moderately priced universal remote controls.

After having to use three remotes to watch TV -  TV remote to power ON/OFF, audio system remote for volume, and Dish remote for changing channels - I decided I needed to consolidate all of them and get one remote (to rule them all).I initially found the Logitech Harmony because it did everything I needed but the price was a little high. Then, I found this remote, the URC-WR7. It was everything I needed for the price I wanted. This remote is freaking awesome!The manual is quite clear and easy to follow. Within minutes, I was able to use the three digit codes to program the URC-WR7 remote for my TV, sound system, and satellite receiver. Then, I used the ""MacroPower"" feature to allow me to turn on all the devices with just one press of a button and turn off all the devices with the other. I really like the separate ON and OFF buttons, it's brilliantly convenient -  Every remote should do this. Next, I used the ""SimpleSound Total System Volume"" feature to make the volume buttons in all modes control the Onkyo surround sound system's volume (which takes care of all my audio). I used the channel macro so that the channel buttons always control only the Dish box.Another awesome feature is the ""learning mode"" where you can teach any button on the URC-WR7 a command from any old remote! For some tricky settings like the Onkyo's input modes, I just used to learning mode to teach it the commands - the process was ridiculously easy! You just enter learning mode, press the button where you want the command stored, point the remotes at each other and press the button on the old remote. Two blinks and viola, the URC-WR7 has learned the new command.For about $20, I was able to get everything I wanted from this remote - I was able to control all my home theater devices with just one remote and I didn't have to change the remote mode everytime I wanted to mute, change the volume, or change channels. The programming is surprisingly easy and fast. With the learning mode, you can basically teach this remote any function from an older remote. This remote is a beast!For those comparing this with a Harmony, the only drawback is the lack of computer-connected programming which I assume would be a little simpler. But for those that are even remotely good with technology, programming this remote should be a breeze!

My previous URC remote was actually a nicer model with a programmable LCD screen, however, LCD screen don't take to being stepped on...I actually prefer this remote anyways, I don't really care for touch-screens anymore, and while the other remote was very well built, not having an LCD screen means this remote can take a ridiculous amount of abuse.The biggest selling point of the remote is its features to price ratio; it really has everything you need, since URC has a great learning function on their remotes, and at this price, you really can't go wrong. This won't compete with flashier remotes; it doesn't have an LCD, so it's lower on the ""cool"" factor I suppose.

Merely enter into setup, push the button on the URC remote you want to program, line it up with the OEM remote you wish to learn from, and hold the button down on the OEM remote you want to learn from.The other nice function on this remote is a very bright backlight on all keys at the push of the button; useful for pushing buttons in the dark during a movie.This remote is sure to please those who are easily frustrated by remotes; logitech remotes are nice, but for those who are used to regular remotes, they're more likely to be frustrated by them.

A334X43BAT8DWH,B001KC08A4,powwoww3,"[1, 1]","We bought this remote to replace a Logitech 1000 touch screen remote and a TiVo slide Bluetooth remote. We were unhappy with programming the Logitech because the company makes it nearly impossible with a Mac computer and the TiVo slide remote was way to responsive. Routinely the TiVo slide remote would get lost in the couch cushions then change the channel or somehow get buttons pushed which would interrupt the recording.This remote has been the best remote we have purchased by far. The remote was very easy to set up and I had it programmed within 30 min, and that includes learning the functions of two devices. The remote code database had my receiver in it (onkyo 805) but the general codes did not work for my Tivo premiere or Apple TV 2. I was able to program all of the TiVo functions from an old TiVo remote (a non Bluetooth one) and the Apple TV was able to learn the remote functions on its own without any issues. The remote feels good in our hands and most buttons seem logically laid out, with the exception of the pause and play buttons in my opinion.Minor gripes would be the remotes signal strength and the remote code database. I had to manually learn the remote functions for each button on the TiVo remote, even the 0-9 numbers and every other button. The learning function is very easy to do, however, so that makes it much less of a gripe that it would be otherwise. I think the code database should be updated a bit more often so manual learning isn't required.The last small gripe would be that we wish the remote signal was a bit stronger. The remote has to be pointed at the component rack to work or the signal isn't received. The signal only has to go 10 feet and past a thin glass door which shouldn't be that difficult. A bit more signal strength would be nice but it is again, a small gripe.Overall I'd rate this remote as 4 stars even if it were 100 dollars, but at 20 dollars shipped, it was a steal.",5.0,Love it,1357516800,"01 7, 2013"

This has nothing to do with IR vs. RF, but rather the fact that the DVR requires a DIFFERENT FREQUENCY of IR.I can confirm that this remote control transmits the correct frequency to my RNG-200, as well as the correct frequency for other IR devices.Hope that helps.",5.0,For the benefit of (many) Comcast/Xfinity customers,1358294400,"01 16, 2013"

Fortunately the learning feature is very easy to use so having to do 6 to 10 tries for a few buttons is not a great hardship. Even when the WR7 blinks twice to indicate that it has learned, it may not have learned correctly. I had three buttons that had to be ""learned"" 6 to 10 times before the WR7 actually learned then so they actually functioned correctly. I primarily watch DVDs or programs off my DVR so the play/FF/FR and pause button layout of this remote are just great. The only real downside of this guy is its weight -- it definitely is heavier than all of my five other remotes (it also doesn't help that its a bit slippery because of it's smooth finish and the fact that there is no detent on the back to hook for fingers on so it tends to want to slid down in your hand).

I'm so glad not to have to dig up 3 remotes in order to watch a DVD or Roku. Since I recently had surgery, I was hardly using the them at all, because of restrictions on bending and reaching. Now they are getting a workout!I was able to program my 2 year old Vizio HDTV with one of the Quick Setup numbers (awesome!) but everything else took a bit more. My Comcast Motorola DVR used one of the three-number codes. With the URC, this was a lot easier than with other remotes, because you don't have to start over at step one each time a code doesn't work - you just keep entering codes until one works. Our 9 year old Bose Wave CD system took one of the three code combinations, but it only worked for a couple of the functions. I had to use ""Learning Mode"" for most of the functions. Same for our brand new Sony 5 CD changer. Only the Learning Mode worked for our Toshiba VCR/DVD Recorder/Player and our Roku remote. The Roku was pretty tough to crack. I had to give up and try another day, and even then, it took two tries, but it was worth it! Now I pick up one remote and can do almost everything the individual remotes do - and everything necessary for day to day viewing is available.No more grabbing the TV remote just to select the input and control the volume, no more searching around on my obscure small-buttoned DVD controller to rewind or fast forward or find the subtitles, and no more going back and forth between two or three remotes just to watch anything not coming from the cable.

A3AKS7YBQ6B2PI,B001KC08A4,R. G. Godbold,"[0, 0]","This is a great remote; I can't find anything better at this price range. I can find the common buttons by feel, and the backlight is really appreciated. I love that they have both the programmed codes and the learning functionality. I always start with the pre-programmed code setup, then &#34;fill out&#34; the remote with learned functionality. I didn't personally find it daunting to program, but like all universal remotes, the trick is figuring out how to make it so other people can use it without me having to train them.So, to that, I have a few things that make it so it's still not the &#34;perfect&#34; no-LCD universal remote (for me, of course).First, there needs to be &#34;component&#34; power buttons and &#34;system&#34; power buttons. The point is that there is always a need to be able to explicitly mess with power on/off for a component while at the same time having a macro button that will be used for &#34;system on&#34; and &#34;system off&#34; for a particular component. For example, I want to watch something on the Blu-Ray player, so I'd press &#34;DVD&#34;, then the &#34;system on&#34; button for a macro that would turn on the sound, TV, and Blu-Ray, then setup the inputs appropriately. But there's all sorts of things that could happen to make it so the macro didn't get me to where I want to be.  And if the macro is assigned to the &#34;system on&#34; and &#34;system off&#34; buttons, you can't explicitly turn just the component on/off---because it's a macro. (And you can't use the component buttons as a macro because then you lose the ability to just switch between components---if they had made those buttons be a macro only if you did a &#34;long press&#34;, that would technically solve the problem, but the instructions don't indicate that's how it works, so I didn't experiment.)Second, they need to add some more dedicated buttons: &#34;Home&#34;, &#34;Return&#34;, and &#34;Eject&#34; would be very helpful. Blu-Ray players have loads of extra functionality nowadays. Mine has built-in use for the existing &#34;Menu&#34;, &#34;Guide&#34;, &#34;Info&#34;, and &#34;Exit&#34;, plus it also has the 3 mentioned above.Third, their 4 custom buttons at the bottom directly correspond to the yellow, blue, red, and green buttons common on Blu-Ray remotes. They need custom buttons that don't obviously correlate to existing functionality on the stock remotes. It's kind of like calling the &#34;Record&#34; button a custom button just because most people don't have a device that would support that functionality.Again, all that said, it's still the best no-LCD universal, learning remote that I've found.",4.0,"Really nice remote; needs a few changes, though",1372118400,"06 25, 2013"

WOW... for under $20.00 at Wal-Mart this thing does every thing I wanted it to do and then some. Amazing.. The learning function is awesome all though it took a little time to program it this way because I played with it a little and found out you can even cross program two remotes into one function. Like on my remote I programmed my cable box using two different remotes. This remote now controls all the functions my cable box remote did (Menu, Guide, Channel up/down, pause, play, fast forward, rewind, record, stop all the number buttons, last channel and so on) but I used my surround sound remote to program this remote in cable mode to adjust the volume on the sound bar instead since I have the volume on the TV turned to zero and rarely use it.. I only use the sound bar so now in cable mode when I hit volume it turns up the sound bar instead same in DVD/Blu-Ray mode the volume buttons adjust the volume on the sound bar not the TV. Going the ""Learn"" mode takes some time but works out better in my opinion because even though the remote had a code for my Samsung TV not all the buttons worked correctly or in the way I wanted them to.... In the learn mode you can make this remote work EXACTLY like the original remote and it took me about an hour and you can even go back if you forgot to program a button and reprogram the one button you missed or want to add with out messing up every thing you have all ready done.On the negative side (nothing is perfect) you can set up what they call ""Macro"" programming which turns on all the devices you program at once with the touch of just the power button. Mine is programmed to turn on the TV, Cable Box and Sound bar with one touch of the button. For what ever reason it will not always power on/off the sound bar even though the button lights up saying it's sending the signal and even when your right in front and aiming directly at the sound bar's sensor. But pushing the Audio button and pointing it at the sound bar it works every time. Just not in the single touch function. Why? I dunno.. The other thing that isn't too bad once you get use to it is the remote has two ""power"" buttons.. One that says on (green) and off (red) with my Blu-Ray player I didn't want it programmed to turn on with every thing else so I didn't program it to turn on. You have to manually do it and in doing so you have to hit DVD and then push the Red ""OFF"" button... If you hit the green ""ON"" button it turns the TV and Cable box off (The one touch Macro programming) so you have to remember when turning on the DVD/Blu-Ray to use the off button. it also does not have the Fancy LCD display or touch screen like some of the other high end remotes have but I didn't really need all that. For under $20 at Wal-Mart this thing works great... I was going to get their URC-R6 remote which Wal-Mart had for $17.96 but were sold out (Best buy AND Target were sold out of the R6 but had ONE W7 left on the shelf for $19.96 only difference is a 6 device vs a 7 device remote (I only have and use 4 devices)",5.0,What a remote....,1262476800,"01 3, 2010"

In either case you will be out of sync, and can only get back in sync manually (or by using an original remote) to get the devices lined up in the proper on/off state as designed by your macro.I'll keep the remote because the power button on the original receiver remote has gone south and I need that functionality.

AY3L8MFNPOU22,B001KC08A4,Rochefort,"[13, 13]","I purchased the WR7 to replace a more complex and now discontinued remote, the URC MX-500, which has an LCD and ten soft buttons.  So, I am experienced with programming URC remotes, and the procedures for setting up macros, punch-throughs and device keys on the WR7 are very similar to their other remotes.  Unfortunately, the documentation on how to do this on the WR7 is pretty sparse, and in places incorrect.  But I like the fact that once programmed, this remote is much more babysitter/guest and kid friendly than the one it replaced.  I have the remote programmed to switch the appropriate inputs/outputs of all of my components on a single button press, although you can also set it to switch on a ""press and hold"" and let the single press simply change the remote to control that device.  For example, pressing my SAT/CABLE button switches my receiver to the SAT input, turns the DVR on (this is a discrete power command so it won't turn off if it is on already), sets my plasma to Input 1, sets my receiver to Output 1, and ends on the SAT ""page"" so the DVR buttons are active.  It does most of what the powerful LCD remotes do (even more in some cases) at a much less expensive price.  The only ""training"" I have to do for babysitters and guests is to tell them to keep pointing the remote at the TV until the remote stops flashing and everything is switched over (the appropriate device button illuminates on every command sent).  The ""look and feel"" are pretty good; the remote is nicely weighted toward the back end with the battery compartment and it is easy to tell without looking which end is forward when you pick it up.  The red backlight is terrible, especially in very dark environments, but it is functional.  The buttons are a little mushy but no worse than other remotes in this price range.On to programming.  I have a Panasonic plasma display panel, Oppo DVD player, PS3 with IR (that accepts PS2 remote commands), DirecTV HD DVR, and Marantz AV receiver.  I first tried the scan programming method (""Quick Set-up"" in the manual) and found that the only device that worked really well was the DVR (except the four ""color"" buttons and the dash (-), which I learned from the original remote).  The others had some ""secondary"" buttons missing or in strange places.  I opted to learn the other buttons for all of the other devices, but that was what I was most comfortable doing, based on my MX-500 experience when learning IR codes was the only reliable way to program that particular remote.  The code entry method (the manual calls this ""Three-Digit Set-up"") would probably work fine for the other devices, but the manual learning ensured I could set up the button layout the way I wanted the first time.  Since then, I have purchased a second WR7 and used the code entry method to set up my second TV (a 6 series Samsung LED), and that TV code was perfect except for missing discrete power commands, which I programmed from an RCA RCRP05B I had set up using code entry and discrete power EFCs.There are a few errors/omissions in the manual that can lead to confusion.  Pages 25 and 26 are both labeled ""Channel Control Punch Through"" when the latter is actually ""Transport Control Punch Through"".  The instructions are correct on both pages, however.  The four color ""favorites"" buttons can be programmed as individual codes for individual devices (PS3, plasma and DVR all use color buttons for different commands in my setup) and do not have to be system-wide macros.  The automated activity macro procedure on Page 21 is incorrect.  You need to press and hold the component button and mute button together, not the component button and select button (to help remember this, it's the same way you program the system on and off macros on Page 19 and the favorites macros on Page 20).  The on and off buttons can be programmed for individual devices AND be used in system on/off and component/activity macros, so you do not need to waste separate buttons to learn the discrete power codes (all the three-digit pre-programmed codes I tried had power toggle instead of discrete on/off).  This allows you to program a ""system on"" macro that will work even if one of your components is already on, for example.In summary, this is the most powerful IR learning remote in its price range that doesn't require complex programming procedures like JP1.  It has powerful features like power and activity macros, punch-throughs, and the ability to learn discrete commands that some much more expensive remotes lack.

My main purchase reason was to get a remote to work my TV and the Comcast DTA box since the Comcast remote did not work properly with either the TV or its own box! I want to let people know that the quick set-up instructions do not work with the Comcast DTA. The instructions say you have found the right code when the device powers off but the Comcast DTA box cannot be powered down except by pulling the plug (boo to Comcast for wasting energy). The method I used was to try the codes until the channel up down worked and that code was 313. I also programmed the channel and volume punch-through so that I never need to use the device select -- great feature.  It is doing all the basic things I needed and has simplified my cable experience. The other two remotes are now in a drawer. I love the back lit keys function.I looked on the universalremote.com website to see if there was an updated manual but the manual there is an older rev than the printed one that came with the remote.  I was looking because my manual says that the FAV button can be programmed with macros such as for favorite channels but when I tried I could not get it to work. Right now my FAV button seems to working as an SAP channel select. I have not tried programming macros on any other buttons -- I'll see how that goes with the MY FAVORITES buttons.My concern was to find a remote that was compatible with the Comcast boxes since not all are. Since it works so great I plan to buy a second one for my LG HD TV with the Comcast HD box and Sony Blu-Ray sound system. That should replace 3 remotes.update 2 weeks later: I programmed the 4 ""my favorites"" buttons with 5 channels each for a total of 20 favorite channels. Two buttons for my wife's favorites and two buttons for my favorites. Works good but it is a little slow to cycle through the channels with each button push.

Mine is currently running a Sansui HDTV, a Sony Blu Ray player, an LG DVD/VHS combo machine (one mode for each &#34;half&#34; of the machine), the Dish satellite Joey, the Roku, and an HDMI Switcher that I got that came with a little remote and an eye to receive the channel-switching command.For the price-to-convenience ratio here, it's ridiculous.It's got a light button at the bottom that backlights all the buttons in red.  Easy to see and red doesn't mess with your dark-room vision if you're watching a movie with the lights low.

Just a nice feature all remotes should come with.Also has a bank of 4 colored buttons that you can assign to be used as &#34;favorites&#34; (each will cycle through a list of specified channels when pushed).  Red can be you, blue can be your significant other's channels, etc.It's solid but not heavy--does not feel like a cheap-o replacement remote.The only downside is that the device buttons are already labeled, and they just can't anticipate your exact needs, so I have to remember that the &#34;CD&#34; button is actually the HDMI Switcher, for example, or that the &#34;AUD&#34; button is actually for my ROKU, but it's no big deal, and everyone in the house had it sorted and fine in a day or so.The only reason to get another universal remote is because you need to run more than 7 items, or you need something that does RF (which this doesn't do as-is--luckily, my Dish Hopper system and the ROKU XS can receive both IR and RF commands.), or you just want something with an LCD screen on it.  In which case, you want the URC R50--not to be confused with the R40, which you will only want if you can't get an R50 (URC pulled a &#34;Microsoft&#34; and &#34;upgraded&#34; the R50 to something slightly less capable than the previous version--I have an R50, too, and it's awesome).",5.0,Can't Beat It,1399766400,"05 11, 2014"

After weeks of hankering for one of those much more expensive remotes that require a computer to program, finally common sense won out and I ordered this one. It arrived last night and this morning, in less time than it takes to drink my second cup of coffee, I had it all set up. The DVD player is an old one:Philips DVP5982 1080p Upscaling DVD Player; the TV is a Vizio LCD.Without any need for tweaking things via the ""learning"" mode, all 3 devices were easily set up using the list of 3-digit codes that came with the instructions. The instruction booklet is well-written and very helpful, and that's not something to be taken for granted these days. I was easily able to set up the feature which allows the volume/mute control to always relate to the TV. There are some macros and favorites and other features that I may set up later, after I've used this awhile.But for now, it's all I need, and I love the easy to find button at the bottom that lights up all the buttons. For this price, it's a great deal.I ordered this remote because I'd become frustrated with the remotes required for my ""first string"" (living room) TV/Cable-DVR/DVD-bluray setup. But between ordering and delivery, I decided to go ahead and get another remote since I have two video setups and I was impatient to get the living room mess under the control of one remote. So I went to Target and bought a similar remote made by GE -GE Backlit Universal Remote Control, and it's now controlling my living room setup. So I've set this remote to control my ""second string"" (bedroom) TV/DVD/Cable-DVR. I like the GE remote, but I like this one better. The size, the ergonomics, the layout of keys: this one is definitely superior to the GE.EDITED on April 14 to add: After using this WR7 remote for a few days, that GE remote really suffered by comparison. Compared to the WR7 it felt awkward to hold, and the button layout was awkward. Also, the WR7 interacts beautifully with my Comcast HD cable box/DVR unit, no tweaking required. The GE remote was bad for that: the cable TV and DVR functions were handled as if they were performed by two separate boxes, which I found annoying to say the least. So I decided the GE would just have to find a new home (probably will go into the Goodwill donations box). I ordered a second WR7 remote, which is now controlling my living room TV/DVR/Cable/DVD/Blu-ray.",5.0,"Silly me, I should have bought this long ago",1302220800,"04 8, 2011"

A2E371JQV40GTS,B001KC08A4,"ThisGuy ""ThisGuy""","[4, 4]","I got this remote at the same time as a Harmony 650.  The Harmony was for my complicated main system, and this was for a secondary TV (with its associated cable box, DVD player and receiver).  I want to say up front that this remote is a good value, and is great for a simple system.Programming was relatively straightforward -- if you have ever programmed a cable company's universal remote, you know the drill (in fact, I think that URC makes the remotes that many cable companies use).  You have a booklet of three digit codes, and you do a bit of trial and error to get the thing to work with each bit of equipment.  Then you can program some specialty macros or special-use buttons, and you can force-program some buttons (so that the channel up/down will always control your cable box, regardless of what piece of equipment the remote is set to, and the volume will always control your receiver).  That said, it requires a bit of fiddling.After that, you can control everything in your system.  I use it to control four components.My problems with it are the following:1.  It is not particularly friendly to guests unfamiliar with your system, or to family members who are not technologically inclined.  If you want to do anything other than watching TV, you can control it all with this remote, but you need to know what you are doing (changing inputs, managing menus, etc.)2.  The four-way directional control is inaccurate and you often get wrong inputs.3.  There is no way to tell, just by looking at the remote, what piece of equipment it is set to control at any given time.  Given its price point, this is not necessarily a big deal, but it can lead to confusion (a lot of, &#34;Daddy, the TV isn't working!&#34; and then a lot of armchair forensics to figure out what was knocked out of whack.)I would recommend this to someone who wants to cheaply control a complicated system, or someone who has a simple system.  It is absolutely a great value.  That said, if I was to do this again, I would have gotten two Harmony 650s (in fact, I'll eventually replace this with another 650).",3.0,"Twitchy buttons, not good for making a complicated system simple",1374624000,"07 24, 2013"

The WR7 controls them all to both my surprise and satisfaction.  The amazingly effective 'Learning Method' made it possible to transfer individual functions to the WR7 directly from my old remotes. I found no function that would not copy.  I was even able to transfer a 30-second skip forward function from the Comcast remote, which was a button that I had reprogrammed on the original remote.  The most important part of the process is READING the instructions carefully.  Once one does that, things go very smoothly.The reviews of both the WR7 and the Sony RM-VL600 were quite positive, so I found it difficult to choose.  The deciding factors for me were that the WR7 had a backlighting button (which works nicely) and that I slightly preferred its button layout.The biggest problem with these lower priced remotes is that the number of functions to copy is large and the number of buttons to copy them to is limited.  I found that I had to make very few compromises, however.  The four 'my favorites' button can be programmed for things other than direct channel selection and they were my life saver for cable functions.  Two of them access cable channels but the other two take care of 30-second skip forward and the corresponding skip back.

Charschan ""author  Cheating Mother...","[1, 1]","This remote is well made, and having had a custom programmed remote by the same company for my other system, I expected the build quality to be great and it is.  I used it for a new television in my bedroom, to program it to control the television, cable box and the sound bar I purchased which is by Boston Acoustics.  While it is not complicated to program, you may have to read parts of the programming manual a few times because some of the functions like memorizing IR codes requires a few steps as well as the punch through functions that allow you to override and in essence simplify operation for anyone who uses the remote.For Fios, the remote did not have buttons for DVR and for On Demand.  The remote has separate on and off buttons so I programmed the off button which would never get used to be the DVR button.  On the bottom of the remote, it gives you four button for personal favorites.  I used one to memorize the on demand button and a second for the description.  The nice thing is that some of the other extraneous functions that sometimes get pushed on the verizon remote by accident are now eliminated, so no by accident closed caption, or their icon system which is an annoyance.When finished, one button turns on the sound bar, the television and the cable box reliably.  Since there were no codes for the sound bar, I used the receiver button and had the main functions memorized under this for both the sub woofer volume and the regular volume, using the volume buttons.  I used the over ride to make sure both the cable box and the television would default to volume on the sound bar only (since the internal television speakers are turned off in this setup) and when the channels are selected, it defaults to the cable box in any of the three modes.What it all means is that whenever anyone turns on the tv, it turns on the cable box, the tv and the sound bar all at once and if they change the channel or the volume, the channel will change and the volume will go up and down regardless of which mode or button was pressed on top.  In other words, it just works.  Most of your guests or non techie types just want to turn the tv on and change channels or volume, and this remote allowed this flawlessly, without having to be a tech expert (although I have done this before with more complicated remote setups)Finally, my dvd is set up separately.  To use it, all one has to do is push the dvd button after selecting the right input on the tv and you are now watching a dvd.  Great remote for the money.",5.0,A great remote for the money,1341014400,"06 30, 2012"

It appears to be a solid, well-made product that operates as described. Both the learning feature and the backlight work perfectly. I have an audio sound bar with a brand not listed in the remote's manual of codes. The learning feature takes care of that problem easily. The user's manual is well-written, comprehensive and easy to follow. I called the customer service toll free number to clarify some information and I was able to speak with a helpful technician within several minutes.There was one issue. I have a cable DVR and was expecting that there would be a dedicated DVR List button on the remote to access a listing of previously recorded programs. Unfortunately, there is not. However, since it is a learning remote, you can improvise. I assigned the DVR list to the unused green button at the bottom of the remote.

A3JON1VH7DETTI,B001KC08A4,Wilson Chan,"[5, 5]","This is simply the perfect remote control that meets requirements of all of my components. It controls up to 7 components which is more than enough for me. I have a Vizio TV, Onkyo receiver, AIWA CD Unit, TIVO, and Liteon DVD Recorder. The remote control comes with working codes for all these components except for Liteon DVD Recorder. The code provided does not work, but thankfully, the learning function is smart and easy enough to program the remote control to work with my DVD Recorder. The learning function is simply powerful and flexible to use. The instruction guide is VERY EASY to read and follow. I love the backlight function that lights up all the buttons clearly in the dark. The overall size is just right and feels good in my hand. The price is more than reasonable at $20.

Had an mx850 before this for 15 years and it's finally worn out.  But nobody in the house could figure it out so I tried this - something simpler and less expensive.  The layout is pretty good although there is no list button and the volume/channel buttons could be closer to the center of the remote.  The red backlighting is not optimal on black lettered buttons but it's usable.  The light button could be better placed on the side near your thumb like most other remotes.  The my favorite buttons are independent of the component selection so you program them once and they apply to all components.  I used the vcr component (who still uses a vcr) to learn the commands that don't have buttons like sound field (2 ch stereo, 7 ch stereo, dolby, straight, surround etc) and the speaker zones like spkr a and spkr b.  Then use these for on the my favorite buttons with stop macros to cycle through each sound program and each speaker configuration.  I programmed the list and subtitles command to the FAV button.  That's about all the commands I commonly use that don't have assigned buttons.  For 25 bucks, it works really well.  But when it comes to controlling the lights, I needed to map the volume button to the dim/brighten function, the input and Fav to the on and off, and then number buttons to the light selection.
