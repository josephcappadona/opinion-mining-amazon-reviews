"[2, 2]",1282608000,A21A9F84S9AZIP,"I was little skeptical about buying this one. Portapros are produced all the way since the 80s and have a flimsy look. My doubts continued as I was unpacking my Portapros. Could this little, flimsy, plastic set of headphones be that good? All of my doubts have evaporated once I have tried using them. These headphones have two big pros:1. Sound quality: One thing you should be aware of is that these headphones are _loud_. I have compared them to my Sennheiser HD201 and Sony MDR-A34. There is no comparison. Portapro is much louder. Of course, if you don't like it, you can turn down the volume. However, despite the loudness, the sound is excellent. I can pick a lot of details in my music CDs that were nearly undetected with the MDR-A34 and barely audible with the HD201. When I play first person shooter games, I am getting excellent directional sound.2. Comfort: The comfort is excellent. The headphones sit very tightly on my head and yet they don't apply much pressure to my ears. I can wear my Portapros for hours without feeling any discomfort. The reason for this, is that these headphones come with extra cushions the sit above your ears and shift some pressure to your head leaving very little pressure on ears. You can also choose how much pressure you want to have applied to your ears. If the default is too much, you can shift some of that pressure to the auxiliary cushions by changing the ""Comfort Zone""  settings (the blue buttons above the driver, it's best to start playing with them once you already wear the headphones). Since the headphones sit tight on your head, they're suitable for outdoor or gym use. The cable length is just right to reach your PC speaker or mp3 player (about 3 feet), but I suppose that some people will find it too short. Finally, the set folds easily and fits into a small leather bag provided for portability.And, have I mentioned lifetime warranty? If they ever break, just send them to Koss with a $6 check. They'll fix or replace them for you. Overall I am very satisfied and would recommend these headphones to anyone who needs cheap, reliable headphones with good sound quality for either indoor or outdoor use.","08 24, 2010",5.0,B00001P4ZH,The best computer/mp3 player headphones for the money,Akop Pogosian

If you listen mainly to hip hop where booming bass is important, you might want to check out other makes. I listen to all types of music, so this is a good all-around headset for this purpose.It does look a little dorky, but sound quality is more important to me than looks. The headband does pinch your hair occasionally, if you're not careful adjusting it. Mine did not come with a case. It came with a soft pouch instead, so not a whole lot of protection there for traveling purposes. Even in the folding position, it's not easy to get it in the pouch. The sound does leak (enough to bother my wife as she's lying next to me in bed). The ear foams feel a little weak and may wear out quickly after frequent use. Don't know if you can buy the foam separately. I gave it 4 stars mainly for sound quality and price ($30-$40).

The cable itself is a little too short for my tastes, about 4 feet. This means I feel tethered to my laptop often. But more importantly is the quality of the cord. The cord itself feels like a wire stuck in a narrow sheet of plastic. The reason that is important is because the wire holds its shape any time its folded or bent.

More money will buy a headphone that excels in one area, but to truly outperform these overall is getting up there.

Turns out, these have a lifetime guarantee, and for $6, they will repair or replace them for you.  I got the new pair in rapid order-- total turn-around was about 10 days.  Caution--if you send these in for repair, do NOT include the pouch;  they returned only the headphones, without the pouch.  Anyway, it was really nice having the new headphones.  BUT, this morning, I picked them up to put into the little carry pouch I use for my Nano and headphones, and found that the left earpiece was dangling again, broken at the swivel point.I really like the comfort of these headphones and the fact that I don't have to crank up the volume to hear.  But, I am now actively looking for a replacement to use, as these are obviously too frail for the constant folding and unfolding they get for my commutes to and from work.  Sorry to have to do this, but I would change my 4 stars down to 3 (but Amazon is not letting that happen).If you will not be stuffing these in a storage pouch but will be simply laying them on a desk or table, then these are great.  If you plan to fold and open a lot, I now suggest you look for something more durable.Sorry, KOSS!------------origianal review Jan 6, 2007:Quality good enough to make me get  a 3rd pairI have gone through 1.5 pairs of these things, now (my current pair is nearly ready for replacement).  The first pair finally broke apart while folded in the soft bag that comes with it (I had had those about 6 or 7 years) -- I took them out and the left earpiece had broken at the plastic attach point and was left hanging.  My second pair is now only 2.5 years old (purchased April 2004), and the wire at the plug end is getting iffy.  If the wire moves, sometimes the phones go into single ear mode, so I guess one of the wires inside the very thin cable is breaking at the joint.  This plug has a right angle into the player, and it is right at the cord end of  the right angle piece where the wire is weakening.  I am going to try taping it here to keep it from moving, and see if that solves the problem temporarily.I do side by side test with this headphone and others used by other individuals.  I ask them to put the volume where it won't blow out my eardrums, then I listen using their phones and settings.  I then plug in my portapros, and listen.  So far, I have not found anyone's setup to beat  the quality and clairty and volume delivered by these phones.  Usually, I have to turn the player DOWN when I plug in my phones because they pick up so much more than others.If you are prepared to buy a new pair of these every 5 years or so, then these are definitely a good deal.I just wish Koss would send a hard case for storage since I do believe that the soft case does not protect them enough when they are stowed.  Koss could also thicken the cable a little bit to make it more durable, or do a gradual thickening as the cable nears the plug.  When I get a new pair, I will tape that end of the cable to try to postpone this problem -- less than 3 years is too soon for this to happen.Becasue of these two design flaws, I rate these a 4 intead of the 5 that the quality of sound delivers.I listen to jazz, smooth jazz, pop, rock, and audiobooks primarily.Happy listening!","01 6, 2007",4.0,B00001P4ZH,not durable enough -- my revised review changes star rating down to 3 stars,Amazon Customer

I tend to be a bit of an audio snob but I'm using these on a cell phone and occasionally an Ipod. So I understand those aren't going to be able to push a lot of power in order to get a full range.Even with that being the case I was pleasently surprised with the efficiency of these. You don't have to turn them up very loud to get a full sound. Bass is very strong, it can be a little too strong at times depending on your musical taste. I listen to a wide range, from classical, to Hip-Hop and for things like Jazz and Classical I find that these struggle a little because the sound separation is okay, the highs are a little on the flat side and the bass can be a little imbalanced. This isn't to say they sound bad but for music demands with a high range then these aren't going to do as good as they would for something like Mos-Def for whom these are exceptional. The construction is pretty good though the design is very dated but I can live with that because I'm concerned about the sound it produces not how cute they are.If good sound is what your looking for at a great price just listen one time and you'll understand why they're considered classics.

Yes, there is a caveat- I paid $40 for these, and for *that price* they have fit and/or surpassed all of my expectations. I believe these can compete with any headphones in the &lt;$100 range. I do have two complaints, though.Audio: 4/5. Bass is powerful, highs are clear, mids are crisp enough. Perhaps a little too well blended for rock (not much emphasis on treble), but fantastic for acoustic/instrumental pieces and hip hop.I dock 1 star because of the utter lack of sound isolation. Having on-ear pads with no noise cancellation tech really means NO noise cancelling (duh). This is fine, but it also unavoidably detracts from sound quality when there is any noise around you. The pads also bleed sound easily- I had to be mindful even playing at half volume in public.Aesthetic: 5/5. As authentically retro as you can get, since they are literally from the 80's.Build quality: 5/5. Simplicity makes for durability in this case.-1 for hurting your ears after a couple hours of wear. Fortunately, you can adjust the pads so they angle away from your ears, shifting the pressure up to the side of your head. The springy metal band will allow these to fit any head size. +1 for the 90 degree input jack. Straight jacks get bent out of shape too easily; this design won't suffer the fate of many a pair of iPod earbuds.For the price, there is no superior. That much I will assert strongly. If you want audiophile headphones and have over 100 to spend, or want noise cancellation (take the metro to school/work? you won't want to use these.) then I advise looking elsewhere. If you are on a budget and want simple quality without the bells and whistles, these are perfectly suited for you and you will enjoy uncompromising sound quality.","01 7, 2013",5.0,B00001P4ZH,Know what to expect and your expectations will be met!,Anonynja

"[1, 1]",1386201600,A1RVYSEJCY9BJS,"Over the years, I've not had the best luck with portable earphones. Tired of the awful sound of default earbuds, I've experimented with Shure, Bose, Sennheiser,Klipsch, andJVCbrands, ranging in price from $25 to $100, but have never really been satisfied with sound signatures that were either too bass-shy, too muddy, or cramped soundstage. Eventually, I got tired with the uncomfortable and often dirty world of earbuds and decided to go back into the world of on-ear portable phones. Reading at Head-Fi about theKoss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones, I ordered them from Amazon. While no match for myAudio-Technica A900x headphonesat home, I was impressed with the richness and spaciousness of the KSC75s, but it wasn't long before I found the clips uncomfortable for my ears, so after a couple of months I went ahead and ordered the KSC75's big brother, the PortaPros.I couldn't be happier with my decision. The sound signature is very similar to the KSC75s, but there is a touch more bass and depth. It's not a flat, analytical sound, not too muddy but very fun and warm -- perfect for portable listening around the office. They're open phones, so you'll be able to hear your surroundings and anyone nearby will be able to hear what you're listening to at high volumes, so bear that in mind. Build quality is fair, about what you'd expect for the price range, but the PortaPros are very light on my head. Considering that their sound is superior to a couple pairs of $100 earbuds I've used, I'll take the trade in isolation for comfort and sound quality. I'm also a fan of the 1980s styling.They're not perfect. In addition to the openness and build quality, the headband occasionally pulls out a hair or two, but it doesn't happen often enough to be burdensome. While the PortaPros fold down to a surprisingly compact ball, getting them into the included travel pouch can be a tight fit. Overall, the negatives are greatly outweighed by the positives.If you're in the market for a modestly-priced portable set of headphones, the Koss PortaPros are highly recommended.","12 5, 2013",5.0,B00001P4ZH,The Best Portable Phones I've Owned,A.

"[2, 2]",1339545600,A3LWC833HQIG7J,"The PortaPro has apparently been around since 1985. That in itself should tell you something about this product. I recently bought a notebook computer for around $500. It has a 750GB hard drive. Back in 2000 I bought my first notebook. It had 6gb and cost $1,100. In Electronic product terms these should have been retired decades ago. There are good reasons they haven't been though. The longevity of the PortaPro speaks volume about this product.I am fortunate enough to have a Soul by Ludacris SB300. It is a $300 headphone. I like it a lot. It produces an excellent all around balanced sound that brings out vocals and all instruments. The PortaPro does the same. The PortaPro actually sound better. The sound is breathtaking in its accuracy and clarity. They even leak less sound, are lighter, and require no batteries.  The PortaPro bring an unbelievably accurate, well-balanced, rich, detailed, and lush sound for the price. You are getting the music, all of the music, the way the artists wanted it to be heard. It isn't often a product can cost 8 to 10 Times less than other good products but the PortaPro does. You can get new headphones And a new iPod or other MP3 player and spend less than other headphones and still have the better set of headphones.And they are VERY comfortable and light. The headphones themselves are well padded as is the adjustment bar above. And the adjustment bar works. I have it set in the middle of the comfort zone and get just the right amount of snugness. You also get virtually zero sound leakage. It makes the PortaPro the Perfect work headphones: fantastic sound, virtually no sound leakage, comfortable enough to wear all day, very light, foldable and storable.The only nitpicking I can do is that the headband is not padded and they look maybe a little goofy.

If Amazon had a product hall of fame where items made it for a combination of performance and value, the PortaPro would be in it for sure. A great gift for yourself or a friend or family member.

"[2, 2]",1290124800,AN6774EDYBQPP,"So headphones break on me ALL the time. I go through at least a pair every year. I guess I don't treat them amazingly and I like having music on me at all times so they get worn out fast. I realized awhile back I can go two ways on my next pair: cheap and easily replaceable or expensive and higher quality (hopefully lasting longer). I tried the latter a couple times since I'm a bit of an audiophile but this time I was sick of the joint at the jack breaking which is how pretty much every pair I've ever owned has broken (can't wait for the day of cheap, good sound quality wireless!).Then on CNET I saw the Koss Portapro listed as the best bargain headphones and I thought hell why not, my last pair were $10 and they only lasted six months. Got these and I'd say its probably the best dollar to quality value money can buy. The sound is rich and full, especially in the base department. When I first started using them, the treble sounded a little muffled but after a break in period I stopped noticing. I listen to a lot of bass heavy electronic music as well as alternative/indie rock and these cans are perfect for it. Because they're over here, you're not going to get great isolation but its good enough. Loud traffic might leak in a bit (and a good bit of sound leaks out) but its just enough to be aware of your surroundings while enjoying your music. I leave the fit on tight to get the best isolation though you can conveniently loosen things up if you want. They feel very nice on my big head either way with the temple pads. The retro stylings are pretty cool and they're definitely unique in their design.Some problems:I like the portable collapse mode but the included case (which is actually a very nice little pleather bag) is too tight a fit. Every time I squeeze the cans in there I'm afraid I'm going to break them or that I'm wearing the wire connections unnecessarily. I'll probably end up using the pouch for some other purpose though since it is quite nice. Along similar lines, it seems like they cut the cost so low by chucking out a lot of the casing and other ""useless"" plastics on the headset but that makes them feel overly fragile. So far they're holding up fine but they definitely feel a bit light. Likewise the plug is a bit small and looks like a definite Achilles heel. Lastly the cord is only 4' so if your audio source isn't in your pocket or nearby, you may run into trouble sans extension.Summary:Great deal for the money so why not?

"[2, 2]",1351900800,A3DU46KRC2JFKH,"In comparing the Koss PortaPro with the Sennheiser 201, which is a good deal cheaper (and also quite a bit bulkier), I've concluded that both headphones are amazing for the price, but they're quite different. The PortaPro has significantly more bass. I had to keep the volume at about 50% what I keep it at for the Sennheiser. The PortaPro is perfect if you're really into bass, if you're really into the beat. The Sennheiser is better for purity of sound. I just feel that, in general, it gives a truer, purer sound. The sound that the original artist had in his/her head. A lot of people will LOVE the beat on this. But some people will find it overpowering. I'm listening to ""Something"" by The Beatles right now, and I'm pretty sure George didn't want Paul's bass to dominate so much.Or maybe this is the best way to put it: you know how when you go into the movie theater and the previews start playing, you're struck by how great the surround sound is? It's so rich and bassy, you can practically feel your bones vibrate. That's what the Koss PortaPro is like. It's GREAT for watching movies. But it just doesn't give the purest vocal sound for music. If you want to turn up the volume to focus on the vocals, the bass will deafen you.The sound went out in one side after 6 months. The headphones lay on the shelf for a year, because I never got around to mailing it in for warranty (they'll replace it for you but it isn't free). And then I decided to fix it myself, so I got a new plug from Radioshack and got down and dirty with wires for an hour. After 45 minutes I was cursing myself for choosing to do this myself. But finally I got it to work. And to keep it that way, I'm not going to use it on the move. I recommend getting a cheap pair of earbuds for when you're moving around (the Sony MDR J10 is my favorite - it stays on and it has lasted me longer than any other brand), and keeping these relatively more expensive headphones for use at home. As you move around, the wire bends in your pocket, and eventually the connection is severed.Oh, and I agree with other reviewers that these headphones do get painful after a while. But I kind of think that's a good thing...it limits your headphone use and will probably save your hearing in the long-run.

"[5, 5]",1154908800,A2IGPYY0ULFD11,"I was seeking new headphones to replace my iPod nano headphones which are pathetic. I had some Koss earbud headphones that I loved but lost, so I needed new ones. So I came on here to find reviews of other headphones and saw that the reviews for the PortaPro were great. Since I had a great experience with Koss in the past (they replaced my earbuds on my old phones for free, no questions asked), I decided to try these. The reviews are right-on.I'd describe the sound of these phones as if two of the best speakers you've ever heard were on both sides of your head. The sound is great at all volumes. The clarity is such that I can hear parts of songs that I never heard before. The lows, mids, and highs are perfect. Some headphones sound bad at high volumes, and the sound gets muddy and the bass sort of shakes in your ear. Well you don't get that with these. It's like you're in the studio recording with the band. You can tell the difference between a 160kbps, 192kbps, and a 256kbps mp3 file with these headphones. The only thing I don't like about them is that I can hear outside noise, like cars whizzing by (a good thing, I guess) or the engine on the bus. This can be kept to a minimum by turning the volume up.The headphones look big because of the ""headrests"" they have, but  they are ergonomic. I was playing a video game while listening to these phones at forgot they were on because I didn't feel them on my head. They have three comfort settings: light, medium, and firm. They also come with a little case which is nice. The phones fold up to the size of a baseball, and both speakers fold inward. A small clip exists on the bottom of each phone, which attaches both sides together when you fold them. You then wrap the cord up and go. They can fit into a typical pocket. These are portable headphones, and I don't know why people say otherwise.They are some of the best headphones I've ever heard. No surprise Koss makes them. They are also manufactured in the USA so there is no outsourcing of jobs with these phones. I can understand why these phones have been on the market since the 1980s.

"[1, 2]",1325980800,A27IPICV6MUXIE,"To anyone who hasn't tried all the various types of headphones, it is important to remember exactly what these are: cheap portable on-ear headphones. They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they're good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer's sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they're very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn't find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the ""comfort zone"" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn't get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn't catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it's good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you're into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I've certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I'd rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we're talking about value, they're a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you're trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there's really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming. I sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collection.","01 8, 2012",3.0,B00001P4ZH,Gotta be honest,C.

"[1, 1]",1307145600,A3RCGRXYBRKSRC,"I bought these headphones a few years ago, after reading all the glowing reviews on Amazon, and I'm so glad I did.  I'm pretty rough with my headphones, and these things can take a beating.  I ended up replacing a pair after 2 years, which is unbelievable in itself, because I usually go through a pair of headphones every six months.  And it wasn't because they didn't work, it's just because the wire near the jack was exposed and getting frayed.  Here are all the pros:Value:  They are a great value for the money.  I've had more expensive headphones that didn't sound as good.  Even if you don't want to spend thirty-something dollars for headphones and don't care what they sound like, I still think it would be worth it, because you won't have to replace them every six months when something breaks on them.  These headphones are very durable and aren't made of flimsy plastic like less expensive ones are, so in the long run, they would be worth it.Comfort:  These are very comfortable.  There are 2 settings, tight and loose, to adjust for different head sizes.  I've never had a problem with the ear pads wearing out or anything digging into my ears, or whatnot.  These fit very comfortably on my head (I have a big head btw) and I've never had a problem with them sliding off.Portability:  These aren't the smallest earphones in the world, but certainly not the biggest.  They do fold up if you need to pack them and they come with a little pouch to put them in.  I bring them along on trips on all the time and I've never had a problem with them.Sound Quality:  They sound fantastic!  Better than a lot of more expensive headphones.  Though any headphone with the Koss name sounds great, I think these are the best.  Just the right amount of bass and treble.  Doesn't sound tinny, or like you're playing music in a tunnel.  If you're used to less expensive headphones, you're going to hear stuff in your music you never heard before.Ease of Use:  Well, most headphones aren't hard to use, and these are the same.  The only drawbacks to these is I found it hard to adjust to loose/tight setting on the sides and they are sort of of a pain to fold up (which is why I never fold them up).  I've owned foldable headphones that were much worse though.Build:  Awesome!  The headband is metal and the casing for the earphones are hard plastic and very durable.  Not long ago, I accidently broke off one of the earpieces.  Guess what, it pops right back in!  Five stars for build!I've never buy another pair of headphones, ever.  I bought 3 pairs of these, (One for home, one for the gym, and one to replace the ones from home) and I plan to buy more in the future, if need be.  I love love love these headphones.The only slight con I can think of is they aren't 'sleek' looking like other headphones, in fact they look like they came straight out of 1982.  I don't really care what they look like though, and quality of these headphones more than make up for the ugliness.","06 4, 2011",5.0,B00001P4ZH,These are the most awesome headphones ever made!

Sound-wise, I honestly wasn't blown away by these. Yes, they offer more bass than most portable headphones, but the bass on these strikes me as muddy and overpowering. In terms of comfort, after several hours of use, my ears started to ache from the pressure of the headband even with the ""Comfort Zone"" switches set to the lightest setting. In contrast, I can wear my $8 Philips earbuds all day with no fatigue or discomfort.

Out of the more expensive headphones I thought the Bose OE sounded the best (very clean crisp highs, and great bass and VERY comfortable).The only headphones that came close to the Bose OE (in terms of sound) were these Koss Portapros and they cost 1/6th the price!! Some people were saying the new design of the cable meant that they are using cheaper materials or something?? Totally untrue, the headphones feel and look great, are comfortable enough for a good couple hours, and sound amazing!Even if you plan to buy some expensive headphones I really think you should have a pair of these... I actually just ordered a $350 pair of Denon d2000, but I don't regret the Portapros one bit, they are awesome, great bass, good mids and highs (albeit not as good as the Bose, but close enough considering the drastic price difference).Update (after 1 month use): Recently I purchased some Denon d2000 and Beyer Dynamic t990 (both retail over $300) I still can't believe how good the Koss stand up to them. For fun I tried connecting the Koss to my Nuforce uDac-2 HP (amp/dac) and they sound even better; mind you the Denons and Beyers have more clarity but once again considering the cost of the Koss it's worth purchasing for portable use even if you have expensive hi-fi headphones.

"[4, 8]",1250640000,A118A49ORGNEUM,"I got my PortaPro phones yesterday, and I am frankly disappointed.My intention was to use these phones with my computer for music listening at late hours. I was instantly defeated by the useless 4-foot cord length. I should have checked that out, but managed to miss it. Nearly every headphone designed for home use (as these originally were), come with at least five or six feet of cord-length. So right there, I was out of luck. Oh well, I thought, I can always use them with my MP3 player.My second discovery is that Koss, like many headphone manufacturers, is targeting it's smaller phones for the highly lucrative iPod market. This means that the guys in marketing are calling the shots. Not surprisingly, the phones have a cord-length that's right for the iPod crowd but not home users. Further, the sound has the exaggerated bass popular with kids into hip-hop, but at the cost of a balanced natural sound. I would describe the sound as smooth and quite pleasant, but rather unnatural. The low end is very exaggerated and the mid-range is down about 5dB. The highs are also way down, perhaps 6 or 8dB. Using my players equalizer I can make the sound acceptable, but these phones are typical of the ""bass is what the kids are buying"" school of design. Without a lot of tone control effort you should expect a bass-heavy sound that lacks any definition in the all-important midrange. I'm a lifelong headphone listener who has used Grado, Sennheiser, AKG, and even high-end electrostatics. I know good phones. These disappoint. I suspect that most of the reviews reflect people who don't use headphones much.One other point. Koss has been praised for it's generous warranty. Maybe, but read the fine print. Koss will replace or repair the phones (their option), if you provide a check for $6 and suitable packaging. Picture that. I spend $6 for repairs, $3 for a shipping box requiring a post-office visit, another $6 for shipping, and still another trip to the post-office. Some lifetime warranty. Incidentally, I would estimate the phones cost a maximum of $5 to make. Seriously, I base this estimation on material costs and the manufacturing processes, which I am familiar with.In conclusion, I cannot recommend these phones to anyone who values Balanced Sound over punchy bass.","08 19, 2009",3.0,B00001P4ZH,Headphones,D.

"[1, 1]",1283644800,A15OQ0YZCQ787E,"I bought this item after going through so much research. I was interested in this because it is in CNET's top 5 and so many good reviews in Amazon. So I don't think one more elaborated review is not necessary but I want to focus on some issues specifically.1)comfort: I bought a sony MDR-XB500 (for it's extreme comfort and good sound quality) after I buying Koss PortaPro thinking that Koss is pressing my ears too hard because, my ears were paining after listening for couple of hours. Afterwards I noticed that pain is not because of the pressing alone but because of the high bass from KOSS. If you listen at little less volume it shouldn't be a problem.2)Mechanical issues: There are glides on the Headphone for light and Firm wear but when I put them in light mode they just don't stay there. They come to firm position once I touch the phones. One more thing, unless you pull the metal bands to the end they try to collapse. This is not an annoying problem for me because I have a big head. Slowly my ears are used to this, and I can listen for longer times and I am listening at low sound levels. So I changed my decision to return these and I am keeping them.Just to list the Pros and Cons I experienced.Pros: Best sound quality, light weight, portable, extra bass (you love it),Cons: Design not up to the mark, Mechanical issues like glides not staying in their position.

That said they are decent enough for the price. I was a bit spectacle on how comfortable they would be since I shave my head and these have no pads, but they fit fine, stay on my head and are comfy enough.They produce decent sound although somewhat muddy and not as crisp as the PX100s for sure. But since they are mainly for the time I spend on the stair master at the gym, the sound quality is more than adequate. They block most of the background noise, but I can still hear a bit of what's going on around me which is not a bad thing.As for portability, they fold up small enough, but not small enough to fit easily in the carry bag that is provided, which is pretty much useless. Without it, it's a pain since I keep them in a pocket of my gym bag and without some sort of small carry bag the cord easily gets tangled. For some reason it wants to maintain the original coiling it had in the packaging. Hopefully over time it will straighten a bit.

Seriously: I bought them specifically for listening to FTP- begotten MP3 files before I found Napster.These were the best phones I ever found, for these three reasons:1) They aren't monitors, so I can hear humans in my vicinity calling my name. Ear goggles would not allow that.... When my kids are sleeping, and I need to hear any cries in the night, this is critical. Also I could use them at work.2) They provide excellent response range, and I assessed this in my 20's, when I could still hear over 20MHz.3) And now, I swear to you FOURTEEN YEARS LATER, I'm listening to the same phones, and still loving the sound quality.  I've had to replace the pads, I've long since lost the case, but these are the phones hanging atop my computer monitor for when I want good sound quality with my netflix streaming. The metal has not even a blemish.... FWIW, I have not had to replace the temple pads. For some reason those have not deteriorated. I don't get it, logically they should've.Anyway, whenever my kids break these, I will buy another pair, with unreserved exuberance.aside: Koss also OEMs some of the headphones for Radio Shack.

The reviews do not lie...these are absolutely perfect for my purposes.I use these with my MP3 and PMP players, as well as my Blackberry Curve if I'm listening to music on it, and have found the sound to be phenomenal.  Now, I'm no audiophile but these definitely give me more detail than previous headphones I've owned so I'm very happy with them.  They are also extremely comfortable...I needed some over-the-head phones because I've always found earbuds and over-the-ear phones to be painful after awhile (I wear glasses, which are a definite factor).  These have been very comfortable on my ears and I can wear them for hours.  I have not had the hair catching issue that some people mention, so I've been lucky with that as well.Definitely worth the price, and if they ever break down I know Koss will provide me with a new pair.  I know they may look a little strange, but I've never had people comment on that - they just want to know if they are good and what kind they are.The only con is I wish the wire to connect to my devices was a little longer - not a lot, but just a few inches to provide a little extra give.  However, most headphone wires are WAYYY too long, so this is a very minor con.These are not noise-cancelling phones, and they were not purchased for use on planes (I have some foam ear buds I use for that purpose) so I can't comment on how they would work in that situation - I think too much noise would definitely get through.  So just use these in everyday situations (walks, in cars when others are driving, etc.) where it is actually a good thing to hear some of what is going on around you for safety purposes.All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend these headphones to anyone.","07 16, 2009",5.0,B00001P4ZH,Great headphones!,E.

"[2, 2]",1367884800,AJXQJ5KGNLRVS,"I bought a pair for my family computer 5 years ago. Aside from replacing the ear pads once in the 5 years - they have sounded phenomenal and have provided years of good and satisfying use!  The independent reviews speak for themselves. Allow me to put it this way: Koss does not make many models of headphones,have been pulled out of bankruptcy in the 80's because of these headphones, and have not changed the design since their introduction in 1984. With that said, these headphones keep the company profitable - so let that be a testament of how good they are. Furthermore, companies do not change their designs if they struck gold - look at the German car makers and American muscle. They have not changed, have the same accents, and characteristics because you don't fix things that are not broken.Sound Quality:I bought AKG Q460s and they were horrible for the price. I had to sell those nightmares off to buy these. It served me right for considering anything but Koss. After hearing such bad headphones I missed the PPs because I am currently away. I needed these to remind me of home. These sound very well balanced, have great bass, and crisp mids, and lighter treble. I think that bass heads will not like these, but will nonetheless appreciate the sound quality and accuracy of these fairly neutral headphones. They do let in/out sound as they are padded and open air, but they are good for quieter environments and very comfortable. The open airs are better because the diaphragm vibrates freely which makes the bass sound less punchy and boxy. These are also very warm headphones with a presence of mids.Pros: Great sound and lifetime warranty.Cons: They are a little awkward because of the metal band, but you will get over it when you hear how good they are.If you are buying online and don't have the time to test them. Just buy these. It's a no brainer. These are the most liked and most reviewed headphones for a reason.

If you like bass, this is your set- awesome (too much for my taste, really).  Nice not to have to stick anything inside your ear. Pops open too easily when folded up.  Sometimes pulls at your hair when resizing it on your head.  An earpad has popped out of its socket a couple of times, but it pops right back in- seems fragile but is more durable than it looks.  Adjusting tabs on each side reset when you take if off your head.  Consider whether you would rather have noise-canceling or inline volume adjuster before you decide. If not, it's a good choice and a good value.May 2010 update: I had one of the cords pull out of the earpiece and sent it back to the company for a replacement- only paid shipping.

Everything from earbuds to on-ear, and even over the ear headphones.A friend of mine suggested the PortaPros to me. At first I was turned off because of the way they looked, but I decided to take a chance. Once I got them on I think they look cool, and my fianc&eacute; calls them my 'Tron' headphones. I have actually grown to like the retro, 80's look.But on to the sound.. They sound AMAZING. I won't even say 'for the price'. They just sound great. I needed a headphone that were 'open air', that way I can still hear my coworkers around me. These are on-ear, 'open air' design, but don't let that fool you. They have GREAT bass response and sound crystal clear, no matter what the volume is. Keep in mind I work in a pretty quiet environment, so I am not sure how they'd hold up on a busy city bus.The fit is also GREAT. They are SO adjustable. It took me a few days to find just the right fit, but now that I have I will never go to any other headphone for day-to-day use. I have a great pair of Sony 7506's for podcasting / studio environment, but these are so great for work and travel. The way they fold up is genius, and Koss even included a nice little pouch to store them in.All in all, I give it an A!

They were created in the 80's, and because they got such a great response, the company hasn't changed anything about them - including the design. However, there is no doubt whatsoever that the sound quality that comes out of these is absolutely amazing. For the price that you're paying (about 30 bucks), these things are 100% worth the money. They appear a little flimsy, but it's pretty incredible the sound you get when you plug these things in. They also come with a larger plug for other equipment that requires it, which was really convenient for me since I got to use them for my keyboard which requires a 1/4"" stereo plug instead of a 1/8"". Furthermore, they're really not that fragile. I accidentally got my set jammed in my desk and popped off one of the side headphones, but it just snapped right back in and I haven't had any problems.

Many people said that the bass was to much but I found that for the music I listened to it was very rich and supportive to the rest of the music.

"[1, 1]",1402012800,AGC75EPFB7CYD,"I was going to reorder another set of Sennheiser PX-100-II because the cord started to short out at the plug-in point. I like using open air headsets at the office and while taking the pooch for a walk so that I can be aware of what&#8217;s going on around me. Just when I was about to click &#8220;add to cart&#8221;, I noticed the suggestion at the bottom featuring the Koss PortaPro Headphones. I immediately remember these guys from back in the SONY Walkman days! Upon further reading reviews I decided to go for them and here&#8217;s what I think after a good amount of usage (I like to &#8220;grade&#8221; my product reviews). Hope this helps.LOOKS: 7.5 -OK, I must admit that at first I thought they looked very retro and had a nostalgic feel to them. However, as I put them on and looked at myself in the mirror, I started to feel a bit awkward and &#8220;dorkish&#8221;. That sensation intensified as I walked down the street and noticed people giving me weird looks. Honestly, I really didn&#8217;t care, but noticed it nonetheless.BUILD: 8.0 &#8211; These headphones seem well constructed. However, the thinness of the headband, which is made of an aluminum strap, is a concern. I wouldn&#8217;t want to overly bend it for sure. There are also a lot of moving parts and the ear plates are made of plastic. I would not advise to step or even sit on them. The cable is rather thin but overall, if you treat them with respect, they should be able to last and the lifetime warranty puts me at ease.COMFORT: 10.0 &#8211; Hands down he PortaPro&#8217;s are easily the most comfortable headsets I&#8217;ve worn in a long time! They&#8217;re super light so you&#8217;d hardly think they are on your head. The ear pads can feel a bit strange when first putting them on, but quickly become seamless. And they feature a slide to ease pressure, just in case. They are more comfortable and secure on my head than my old PX-100&#8217;s.SOUND: 10.0 &#8211; I proudly own several types of headphones from Audiotechnica, to Bose, to Sony and even lesser known, great quality brands. I love sound (don&#8217;t consider myself an audiophile) so I don&#8217;t take my listening lightly. These little guys provide outstanding performance for the money! The open nature of these headsets provides a very wide, warm, natural feel to whatever you&#8217;re listening to. The highs are very clear and do not &#8220;bleed&#8221; into the other frequencies. The mids are very distinctive and present. The bass is &#8220;punchy&#8221; without being overwhelming (my PX-100&#8217;s were a bit too bassy). I can listen to all genres, from rock, to hip hop to classical and equally enjoy them without adjusting the equalizer setting (flat response). Live music is definitely a pleasure to hear with these guys.FUNCTIONALITY: 9.0 &#8211; Carrying them around is rather easy. They fold into a small, tight &#8220;ball&#8221; and they fit into a little pouch provided by Koss. Getting them into this position is easy and intuitive. They fit into any bag without taking too much space. The cord is light weight and of good length. I wish the 8mm plug was bent 90 because I put my portable device in my back pocket and sticks out a bit. One little gripe that most have is that when placing them on your head, the auto-adjust process happens automatically and you hair can get caught in the sliders. Ouch! But fortunately, that doesn&#8217;t happen too often. They don&#8217;t leak sound as much as I thought they would and that&#8217;s a plus.OVERALL: 8.9 &#8211; I am a believer now! While I do not use these for commuting (subway trains) because of the inability to block out sound, the Koss PortaPros have become the go-to headset to beat while walking around the neighborhood with my dog. The sound quality and comfortableness more than make up for the hit-or-miss retro looks. Highly Recommended.","06 6, 2014",4.0,B00001P4ZH,Surprisingly awesome.,"Insomniak1 ""Insomniak"""

When the opprtunity came up for me to purchase a small headphone, I jumped on it.There are countless reviews here describing about PortaPro.  So I will skip most of things mentioned here.  I will just focus on my experience with it.First of all, Koss was not a known brand for me.  Only time I really saw their product was when I went to Thrifty (now Rite Aid) and saw their cheap earphones in their electronic section.  Naturally, I always thought they just make cheap quality products.  In last year or so, I started looking for a budget price headphone with good sound quality.  And this product kept popping up in reviews and people's recommendations.  I was intrigued by the fact that this product is essentially unchanged since it's launch in the mid 80's.For $25-$35 price range headphone, I am not so sure if there are better headphones.  It sounds just amazing.  Very full and rich low and mid sound (not muddled but clear and balanced).  Highs are not as strong but it is very well balanced with the rest of the sound range.Build quality is just average.  I don't mean it's badly assembled or anything like that.  But even by mid 80's standard, parts used are extremely minimalistic.  Some people commented on the metal adjustable band constantly shifting and not locking in its position.  Basically, it is not designed to ""lock"" into one position.  If you take your headphone off, you will have to readjust the length of the metal band.Another bad thing is that you just look silly wearing this thing.  But I think once you hear the sound quality, you won't mind wearing it.Again, for the price, I don't think you can beat it.*Update:  I LOVE THIS HEADPHONE!  :)","10 13, 2011",5.0,B00001P4ZH,I can't Believe the sound quality on this cheap headphone!,James Chung

I've always loved good sound reproduction, excellent sound range as well as quality.  When I was younger, I used to buy Koss pretty much exclusively.  Lately though, I've been somewhat disappointed though with a few exceptions, the Koss PortaPro being at the top of the list!These headphones have been around since I was a teenager and unlike me, they are still going strong!  They have fantastic sound, they are not overly affected in the bass range (they don't add extra bass for the ""boom boom"" window rattlers out there), they are economical, comfortable and just all around a fantastic buy.  Also, they are recommended by SERIOUS audiophiles as the best portable out there.I can't agree with that entirely; I also recommend the Sennheiser PX-100 and PX-200 depending on your needs.  But of the three, these are the least expensive but offer fantastic sound that you would expect to come out of a pair of full size cans (headphones, I guess I'm learning the audiophile lingo!).The Koss PortaPro have the Comfort Zone temple pads that help make them even more comfortable and the pressure between temple and ear can be adjusted literally by the flick of a switch on ear side of your head.  I have a massive head and these fit me with room to spare.  I like the firmest setting on the Comfort Zone but I've tried the other two settings as well and I can honestly say that there is a difference; it is NOT just a gimmick.  The Comfort Zone really works.These are truly portable also!  They fold up into a little ball that can then be placed into a convenient case that Koss provides.  I personally would recommend buying a semi-hard shell case that Koss also sells just for the extra protection.What more can I say?  If you'd like a few other recommendations in the truly portable range, the Sennheiser PX-100 and PX-200 are rugged, comfortable and highly portable.  (They collapse as well and fit into their own plastic case.)  If you like earbuds, the Sennheiser MX-500 is wonderful with its in-line volume control; the sound is absolutely amazing for something so small.  And finally, the Koss KTXPRO1 is an excellent portable headphone with an in-line volume control.  It uses a Titanium element to drive it.  All of these are great products but ultimately this particular review is about the Koss PortaPro and I really am blown away at how great these tiny portable cans truly are.  I believe you will be too.Though I've become somewhat disillusioned by Koss as I've become a so-called ""audiophile"" (why not just call me someone who really loves good sound to come through good instead of creating a term that sets me apart from everyone else?), I highly recommend these cans to you.  If you are on a budget, you especially can't go wrong.  Remember that Koss guarantees all their cans for life with their ""no questions asked"" guarantee.  It's worth it!  So as my review title states, ""The Koss PortaPro shines in every area.""Oh, one last thing:  Don't listen to people who say these cans are ugly or clunky; they aren't.

The PX100 has headband padding; the Portapros do not and take a few hairs out now and then. Once placed on your head, both are comfortable. The PX100 folds up neater than the Portapros.

The Portapros are also slightly more efficient and play a bit louder.The Sound character of each is a matter of taste. Both headphones sound excellent. Both are sweet, clean and very detailed. Both are non-fatiguing. The Protapros are a bit bass heavy. On some music that bassy sound is magnificent. On other types of music with already prominent bass the PX100 is preferable. Surprisingly, the high frequencies are equally well extended on both headphones. The Portapros are a little sweeter in the high frequencies than the PX100.  The PX100 may be a little more accurate with a slightly better midrange than the Portapros.The PX100 is an up-to-date modern design. The Portapros are classics with a design that goes back 15 years! The original PX100 came with a nice case. The Portapros have a hook and eyelet at the bottom of the metal headband. They hook together to bind them tight to fit inside a small bag. I use neither the bag nor the case. You may want to buy both.

"[2, 2]",1326585600,A2RI4QE6EO29CA,"I have owned a lot of low to mid range headphones in my lifetime. Currently, I have a pair of skullcandy earbuds, a pair of the stock iPod earbuds and a pair of $35 Sony Studio headphones (the big over-the-ear ones).They were not working for me. The sound on the Sony ones were pretty decent, but prolonged use made my ears ache and could get very warm in the wrong climate (like...summer). They were also very heavy, so reading text books or just reading my Kindle, these things would not cut it as it would also put strain on my neck. My ears were just not made for earbuds, as I had various problems with those. The iPod earbuds failed miserably, as the sound was always too shallow for me and they kept falling out of my ears.So, I looked for the most rated headphones (not earbuds) with over a 4 star rating on Amazon and stumbled across these. Over a 1000 reviews and it still had 4 1/2 stars? Yeah, I'll take some time to check these out lol.So I got them a week ago. To avoid any ""premature"" reviewing, I let them sit the first three days with music on constantly, racking up about 36-40 hours of ""break in"" time before I tried them out objectively.First the headphones themselves. They are very, very light. The head band are a couple of thin metal bands with plastic pieces that adjust size. I like this because metal is durable but it's also light and airy and doesn't make me feel like I'm wearing a music factory on my head.The ear pads are more comfortable than I imagined. They are not dollar store ear pads (although they look that way) and are comfortable on the ears.A wildly awesome thing about these phones that people often overlook are all the parts that make them comfortable. The ear pieces themselves are hinged, so they bend depending on the shape of your ear. The metal bands are firm but flexible so it doesn't press too hard on the head or ears. Then there's comfortzone settings. It took a minute to figure out how the settings work, but once I did I was treated to a unique comfort experience. Comfortzone consists of two pads on either side that rest on the temples. The firmer the settings, the more pressure on your temples and less on your ears. I found this awesome as I could sit with these headphones on my head for 8 straight hours and feel no ear fatigue at all.Now for the part everyone wants to read: the sound. I am NOT an audiophile and I won't use any technical terms. The music sounded just plain great. I can hear bass lines in rock songs, hip-hop and rap songs thump (but not uncomfortably so). The music sounds whole and complete and not shallow and airy like iPod headphones do. The high notes sound good and even at high volumes don't cackle or distort and in no song that I listened to did anything sound muddy or wrong. The volume is well balanced. Maxed out is too loud and that's something my other pairs of headphones can't say. I've often had to max out settings just to get a decent volume on my Sony headphones. These I can keep in the middle volume range and it still sounds good.They're not noise cancelling and they leak sound. I'm okay with this because when I jog, I'd like to hear the cars coming before they hit me ;) so if you're looking for noise cancelling and quiet for others, then you should probably keep searching.All in all, for the price, I can't imagine having gotten a better pair of headphones. Personally, I love the retro style of the headphones. Keep in mind that Chucks have fallen in and out of style for 90 years and they're top sellers. This has been in and out of style for nearly 30 years and it's a top seller. I put them in the same category (and, as it happens, own both now) which is ""totally awesome"". If you're looking for some lightweight phones that sound great and have a unique look, then your search is over.

"[2, 2]",1258502400,A2WB7LZ595CR50,"**Update 9/8/10** These headphones are great but they do have one potentially serious design flaw.  The stereo connector is very flimsy.  Despite being very careful, mine broke in under a year.  The stereo connector literally just pulled apart as I was removing it from the ipod one day.  The wires pulled right out of the connector.  After checking the web, I see I am not the only one to experience this.  Someone was even kind enough to post a picture of it above, in the product photos.  I still think they're great headphones and I ordered a new  pair (although I plan to have these replaced under warranty and keep as a spare).  I knocked off one star simply because now I have to shell out $6 plus shipping to replace this set (although I opted to pay $30 for a new pair to save time).  However, if the second pair breaks as quickly as the first, prepare to watch the review stars plummet.  What good is something if it won't last at least a year?*** End of update ****I've tried pretty much all types of headphones. I was looking for a good solid pair, under $50, preferably over-the-ear but not too big (for gym, athletic use and better portability).  I stumbled across these on the web and saw that people loved them, so I came to Amazon to read some reviews.  Seeing that they were highly rated here as well, I ordered a pair.  These headphones have a solid reputation for a reason, they sound great.  The minute I plugged them in, I knew why they were so highly rated.  Clear highs, deep lows.  I mean, it's not bone rattling bass, but it's decent enough if you don't want to lug around a pair of $50+ self-powered heavy headphones.  Easily the best sounding headphones I've bought the past year.  And that's in a group of Skull Candy, Sony, Apple, self powered, noise canceling... I've tried it all the past year.  The only (extremely minor) gripe I have is that I agree with others that it does feel flimsy at times.  I like that the moving pieces are metal instead of plastic (can't tell you how many plastic headphones I've inadvertently broken from simply putting on and removing), but it still has a somewhat delicate feel to it.  They do come with a lifetime warranty, which is pretty sweet, (although a further check of the terms reveal you pay to ship them back and have to include a $6 check.  Something potential purchasers should be aware of).  I'm happy with my set and agree with everyone else that these headphones come in a portable package but possess full-sized sound.","11 18, 2009",4.0,B00001P4ZH,Great headphones but build quality might be suspect,J.

"[3, 3]",1242000000,A7JK2LY3CHJ2H,"I shopped alot before I decided on these headphones i read all the reviews here as well as on many other sites. To tell you the truth I found the hype hard to believe for a product that has remained unchanged since the 80's . I rated these babies a 5 star for the sound quality and price it helps if you have a headphone amp if your using small devices to run them like  IPOD but not mandatory they get pretty loud without my amp and probably would protect your hearing better without it. I can tell and improvement with the amp but it sounds really good just plugged straight into the IPOD . I really like these over my VMODA bass earplugs for certain activities like exercise the bass buds sound better on alot of things without the amp especially but if you walk or ride with the buds in your hear the wire rubbing your clothes it amps up your breathing etc. plus if your walking like I do where people bike or drive you cant hear them coming up behind you , not a problem with the porta pros on. I have to point out that you can hear them if your sitting or standing next to someone wearing them so if your listening to somethiing loud and dont want to disturb others around you they dont work well for that like on a plane, bus, in a car so there are some limitations to it. people made alot of issue with the retro style either for or against. In all honesty they really dont look all that odd on your head and are quite comfy the fact that they fold up to carry in the bag is nice but they are still bulkier than a pair of ear buds. alot of people reviewd them as being studio quality monitor headphones this to me seems a bit much but they are definately on par with any headphones I tried while looking for a new set.I even felt they rivaled the bose over ear set although the noise cancelation you get from the cup does make the bose sound better on some stuff.

So I bought the Koss PortaPro's as a replacement.1. The Koss are not as attractive. Not that important to me.2. The Koss are not as comfortable. The metal head band is cheesy, when compared to the Sennheiser's, and they are only $10 more. The Koss are also a tad too tight.

Not so the Sennheiser headphones. Had I noticed distortion with them, I would have chucked them long ago.Summary: If you want a light pair of on-ear, portable headphones, spend the extra $$ and get the Sennheiser PX-100 (or higher models).

They deserved it. And although the crown had been taken off these by better headphones as the time went by, PortaPro's have still lot to offer and easily beat other competitors twice the price of these or more. I would not hesitate for a second to put PortaPro's above Dr. Dre's Beats (which are an over priced, mediocre sounding) phenomenon these days.Design:PortaPro's draw attention of onlookers as their signature design does look somewhat nerdy. :-) Fit is great, the temporal pads can adjust their pressure, hence alleviating the pressure put on your ears The bridge is self-adjusting consisting of two pieces sliding on top of each other, though, the plastic sleeves on top of the bridge can push into the top of your head and if you have less hair, you may feel it after awhile. Also, if you have long hair, or lots of it (not my problem), your hair could get snagged between the bridge pieces and get pulled.Cable is oxygen-free, has a 45 degree angled 3.5mm jack and splits to go into each side of the headphones. It is not replaceable, so if it breaks, you need new cans. Koss honors limited lifetime warranty, if you register.Sound:They sound as good as my AKG Q460, maybe with a touch more bottom end and a bit more of treble. Due to their construction, they do not isolate outside noise as well, so using listening to your tunes on the train or in the city with lots of ambient noise will make you crank the volume up. Beware, their bass is powerful, so treat your ear drums with some care.Listening to PortPro's at home or during a stroll in a park or quiet neighborhood is a joy.Treble, mids and bass are in a great balance, so these cans do not require much tinkering with EQ. I actually use the ""Flat"" equalizer setting on my iPod.Impedance is 60 Ohm, so you need to turn up the volume a notch or two when switching from a pair of standard 32 Ohm headphones to make PortaPro's sound at the same level of loudness.I bought them at K-Mart which was closing and they had them marked for $32.I will eventually buy the 6-pack of replacement foam ear pads.Included is a nice little faux leather pouch and can fold and fit into it very nicely, so good news for road warriors.","12 17, 2012",5.0,B00001P4ZH,"After decades on the market, they still hold their own",Jiri Krecek

I switched to Bluetooth behind-the-neck models for awhile (Motorola over-ear) and those were great, but I forgot how much sound-quality was sacrificed by the switch. Had to buy new ones after my Motorolas were stolen, so I came back to the cord, a little reluctantly since I use them actively.Glad I went back. The clarity is fantastic. Comfort-wise, I do have to toggle the firmness down to light every time I put them on (and that's somewhat annoying) but the convenience of rolling them up eclipses that. The cord is on the shorter end at four feet, which I appreciate- I've never seen the need for long cords on headphones. If I need to use them at a desktop or something I'll grab an extender. The pouch is gimmicky and a touch small, but serves the purpose- I'll probably put them in something else. The headband can catch longer hair, but I wear a buzz, so that's not a problem. They're even more comfortable than similar models while laying down to sleep. Some people complain about the style, but I've always loved it. They're easier to wear underneath a knit hat, or in conjunction with sunglasses. The design is eternal for a reason.You really can't do better at sub-$100. If your hair is longer, wrap electrical tape around the band- it won't collapse anymore, but you won't rip your hair out. If the stock pads don't satisfy, get some Grado bowl replacements (but the stock pads are fine.) If they break, send them into Koss for a replacement, $6 S&H.; The new model has an angled plug- not right-angle, but not straight either, which I find convenient for preventing cable-breakage but might not work with some cases.A testament to how good these headphones are- my very picky grandfather has gone through several different models of headphones.

As I wrote in my review of the PX-100s (http://www.amazon.com/review/R20I6FUMDQJ2RW/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm), I found them uncomfortable, and lacking in bass.

Short cord for people who don't wander 20 feet away from their audio player (laptop, mp3 player) like some other headphones have.Cons:  I've heard people say how comfy they are, but my hat size of 7 1/2 says very different.  After a few hours they simply prove to tight and give me a headache.  And that's whether I have sound running through them or not.  On occasion a hair might get caught in the metal band but not enough of a problem to warrant not getting them.I use these for my laptop and iPod and they do an excellent job with music and gaming.  Base is kinda bad but for the size and cost it does more then enough.  Mine have the straight plug which is really annoying as I like the 90 deg ones much better but it works regardless.  I'd recommend these to other people. The only drawback I can find is they can give me a headache of using them for a couple hours.  Maybe if you have a smaller head you'll be ok?  They can seem flimsy, but I've had them for 2 years and have traveled with them so I couldn't justify and claims of them being ""cheap"" headphones.  And with a lifetime warranty I say go to town.  I don't use the case at all either, used to, but I deemed it to much of a hassle and lost it somewhere.  No regrets on that.I would give the product 5 stars but the headache thing really detracts from them.

"[4, 4]",1332201600,A1Q9NE8OY1XD5J,"I've had the Koss PortaPro's for about four months now and I decided it was time to give them the review they deserved.I mainly used standard Sony studio monitor headphones for personal music listening when I'm on my desktop computer or laptop, and I would use earbuds with my iPod on the go or in bed at night. I decided I wanted to try these headphones considering the golden reviews they've been getting.When I received them they were a lot smaller than I thought they would be, but they fit my head perfectly and they are very comfortable. I can't even feel them after a while. They do require a little adjusting after some time but my ears don't feel sore after long listening sessions.They sound great and they look great, too. Some people might think they look too wild/retro/geeky, but that's what I like about them -- they are unique in their design. They don't look bad to me at all.They have an extremely clean and crystal clear sound. The highs are crisp, the mids are warm, full, and natural, and the lows are tight, deep, and full-sounding. They do have a little bit of extra bass, but that's no problem for me. I can just turn off the EQ on my computer audio player and they sound perfect. I always have the EQ off on my iPod so they sound just fine there, too. The extra bass really isn't that bad at all. It shouldn't affect your buying choice with these headphones.Yes, they are flimsy and you have to be somewhat gentle with them, but they are surprisingly durable. I've fallen asleep at night with these headphones on and when I wake up finding them near my pillow off my head, I'm worried they had been destroyed. To my surprise, I find no bends or any signs of stress on them. The ear pieces don't even fall off either, and those are held on with just a little plastic clip it looks like. (They pivot to fit the shape and position of your ears.)The only cons I have about these headphones is the somewhat short cable length. It's 4ft. long, but I sometimes find myself accidently yanking on them with my arms when I'm not careful. That's fine though, as I just use another 4ft. extension cable I found. I also have to adjust the headband to almost it's widest when I put them on. I wish there was some type of locking mechanism on the headband.These have become my standard headphones for at-home and on-the-go listening.

I am constantly pulling on the cord by accident or even dropping my mp3 player detaching it from the plug.  Now after maybe 6 months of use I have lost sound in the right ear.  It sometimes drops in and out but this is mainly due to the cable being loose inside the earpiece.  It is pretty much unrepairable.  The Sennheisers also cut out in this same manner but they lasted 2 years.  I guess one way you can look at it is that you can buy 3 of these for the price of 1 PX100.

"[5, 5]",1335398400,AIE03GJ95JW3Z,"28 years. 28 years and counting. This is how long since the Koss PortaPro was introduced, and to this day, they still roll off the production line virtually unchanged since 1984. Talk about market endurance and lasting appeal. This headphone model trudged through and survived the ever evolving portable music industry, from the cassette Walkman, to the era of MP3 players and the iPod and now, the streaming era. It's baffling to imagine how one seemingly unassuming product could accomplish such a feat.One probable cause is the quality to price ratio. The PortaPros have gone up in price over the years, but still, currently at $40, they still remain a great value in headphones because of their unrivaled sound quality at this price point. Koss, for the most part, is known more for their budget headphones but the PortaPro is one audiophile secret that the masses need to know about. These pump out sound so decent, they compare well enough against headphones way beyond  their price range! In fact, I like their sound signature so much that I use them as my starting reference headphones to analyze other sets. They are the ultimate beginner audiophile headphones.So what is it about these cans that make them so great? Why are they revered by fans all over, sparking a rather vocal cult following?Seeing them for the first time, you might not even dare venture to try them on. They look like light, flimsy, cheap 80's headsets. (Which is in a sense, what they really are.) Some may even argue vainly that they are so ugly and hideous, it will be horrifying to be caught dead with them hugging your noggin. ( I find them charmingly futuristic in a retro kind of way, though. Like how sci-fi movies in the 80's imagine what future thingies will look like.)  There's a minimalist no-frills commitment to these headphones' presentation. See, there's just this mere sliding metal headband on top attached to plastic mounts that support two thin, even more plastic, grilled sound drivers, thinly wired, with black foam padding, terminating into a 3.5 mm 45 degree jack. But that same plastic mount gives the PortaPros their unique iconic look and character. It's called the ComfortZone slider and together with the metal accents, it lends the PortaPros that RoboCop/Terminator aesthetic. It was probably a gimmick back in the day because the ComfortZone settings (Light to Firm) hardly do anything for me except point the drivers outward on the light setting, resting the foams on my temples. The PortaPros, therefore, are known and remembered for this look and Koss was smart not to tinker with something that is iconic. And you don't get the PortaPros for their ruggedness or luxurious build quality. They feel so utilitarian they could be the headphones communists will finally distribute to the proletariat. They feel so delicate and fragile that Koss was kind enough to give a lifetime warranty! So basically, if you buy a PortaPro now, you are set for life.At the end of the day, you get the PortaPros because of their sound characteristics. These would never have achieved their legendary status if not for their aural properties. This is why we obsess over headphones anyway. They are not a flash in the pan fad nor are they glossed over by celebrity marketing. These are honest and straight-forward consumer products endorsed by the same consumers themselves.What you get with the PortaPros is surprising clarity and detail, you can't believe a budget headphone is actually piping it out. The drivers on these things are awesome for their price and size but they are not perfect, of course.The high end detailing sparkles with this set although treble is somewhat grainy. Bass is substantial and not overpowering but, however, could get loose in the higher bass frequencies. This low end bleeds to the the lower mids rendering it with a slight nasality. The proper mid frequencies are forward and present but they lack smoothness. Technically, with these faults, you could argue that these shouldn't sound good, but all in all, when you combine these traits, it's actually a pleasurable listening experience.I think, coupled with their specific sound signature, what makes these portable sets shine is their soundstage and separation. Since they are technically open back sets, the soundstage is unconstrained by resonance, giving them this feathery, airy feel.  Instrument separation, as a consequence, is remarkably even and it fleshes detail out. Of course, there a lot of expensive high end sets that could do this better, but if you are upgrading from entry level sets near the PortaPro's price point then the sound difference will be life changing. Like I said, these could rival or outperform headphones twice or triple their price. Some people compare the PortaPros to another open back can, the Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone or theGrado Prestige Series SR-60i Padded Headphones, but nothing could be more different. These Grados are excellent and extremely detailed but they skew more towards the bright treble side of things which could sometimes be too harsh for some people. The PortaPros are tuned more as balanced sets, if not bass focused, what with their slightly forward mids.  Both these Grados and the PortaPros are brilliant entry-level sets , although the SR80i are twice as expensive. I use the PortaPros, appropriately enough,  more for 80's synth pop, rock and new wave while I prefer the Grados for acoustic guitar recordings, and  if you must, do get both.So in summary, the iconic PortaPros are a 20th century wonder for their longevity and enduring appeal. Their price to sound quality and their minimalist utilitarianism is probably the main reason why they have such a following. If you dig that retro chic look and you want a quick entry to quality sound without breaking the bank, then get yourself the PortaPros now!","04 26, 2012",5.0,B00001P4ZH,Koss PortaPro headphones: 20th Century Minimalist Masterpieces?,Kiko N.
"[6, 6]",1178841600,A2MY9VXHZYAHUZ,"Ok, I went on a headphone buying spree, so I'm comparing these PortaPros to headphones that cost many times as much (Sennheiser HD595), headphones that cost a bit more (Sennheiser PX100) and my old Sony headphones. Well, my Sonys are history. I never realized how smeary they were--no detail.These Koss PortaPros hold up very well in comparison with any of the phones I mentioned. Good detail and the frequency balance is excellent, far preferable to the PX100s and even comparable to the expensive phones. Very pleasant to listen to. If I had never heard those expensive phones, I would be happy to have these Koss PortaPros as my only phones.What I've learned by comparative listening is what people refer to as ""soundstage"". With the Koss phones, everything sounds like it is at your ear or between your ears. Not unpleasant, and you won't know what you're missing until you hear it for yourself, but the expensive audiophile phones give you a sonic perspective that extends beyond your ears--far more realistic. I know that considering the price differential this may be an unfair comparison, but I just had to point out that you do sometimes get what you paid for.So the bottom line is, I am in love with the sound of my expensive HD595 headphones and at the same time I am very happy to have these Koss PortaPros for portable use. As a bonus, the PortaPros are even more comfortable than the expensive phones. And, unlike some folks, I wouldn't say they are ugly at all--just different.","05 11, 2007",5.0,B00001P4ZH,Great value.

"[8, 8]",1206403200,A356RFKNIG043B,"5.5 starsFor my 200th review, I thought I'd sing the praises of one of the most useful and wonderful things I've ever owned, the PortaPro. I got these shortly after they came out, as I always longed for bass in my early Aiwa walkman (best of breed back then). These thangs changed my life!I still love music deeply, but back in school it was everything to me, my solace and balm and ecstatic release, hours and hours every day. I still wear mine daily while running the dog, walking the dog, and during various non-dog activities as well. They have tremendously balanced sound, lots of bass but very open and tight bass, not sloppy. The highs are clean and never harsh, the mids smooth and present. From Bach to the Beatles to Metallica to Charlie Parker, they deliver musical sound in a pleasingly full sound spectrum, top to bottom.For the money they are a miracle! They turn any mp3 player into a real sound machine, and BLOW AWAY any of the in-ear phones except for the thousand dollar customs (go to the HeadRoom online if you want perfect sound...they sell these alongside the best cans in the world, say no more). They deliver a surprisingly real soundstage and plenty of truly musical detail.Add to that two great features. They fold up easily and fit in your pocket (make sure to get the folding ones, worth the extra few bucks for sure), making them a perfect companion to tiny mp3 players (they are a perfect match with my Muvo 2gb player, such sound from such tiny devices!).But THE best feature of the PortaPros is the inestimable LIFETIME guarantee!! And they ain't whistlin' Dixie, folks, they mean it. I would know, as I've bought maybe four of these in the last 20 years, but I've owned about 14 new pairs total! Whenever the cords wear out or pull out of the ear (can happen, it's only thin rubber and wire, happens now and then when you're mountain climbing etc), I send them back to Koss with a six-dollar check (only gone up one buck in 20 years) and in a week I get a BRAND NEW pair. If that ain't taking care of the customer, what is?So, for coming through on their promises, and for making a truly great-sounding and very cheap-for-the-quality headphone, I give Koss total props and praise for this product, one of the best values I've ever encountered as a music uberlover. This and a Muvo 2gb player will set you back only a hundred bucks and then give you so much musical pleasure everywhere you go. I have enjoyed my PortaPros on mountain tops, inside the Louvre, Prado, MOMA, etc, by the sea, on ski slopes, on trains in the high alps with views to die for as Beethoven's Sixth took me to heaven, in the subways and busses of dozens of lands, in front of literally thousands of sunsets from Big Sur hills to Jamaican beaches to Mallorcan cliffs to Norwegian fjords and so on for twenty-plus years.I can only imagine how gratifying it must be for the spirits of the great composers to know that their music can now be heard in good sound anyplace on the planet. If we've achieved one useful thing as a species in the last thirty years, this is it: great portable sound that turns any post office line, etc from a nightmare into a dream.In fact, now that I think of it, no product I've ever purchased has brought me this many hours of joy, except perhaps some of my guitars. The Pros were 25 bucks in the mid-80s and are now only 35; with inflation it should be far more. Thank you Koss for proving that some companies still know what value is. This is a bargain of the highest degree. Whoever invented these, I LOVE you!Buy some for a friend; I have, many many times. And make sure to buy some for yourself; your life will become a lot sweeter, especially if you know how to let music take you far beyond this mortal coil.My highest recommendation.","03 25, 2008",5.0,B00001P4ZH,Have used these daily for over 20 years,K.

The quality of sound reproduction, they do deserve a high rating.  If you aren't using them a noisy environment--they have no real passive or active noise blocking.  You can't be dissatisfied with the quality of sound reproduction.I was surprised by the light build and somewhat small size of them.  They certainly don't make a satisfying thud when you toss them onto a coffee table -- which probably isn't that good of idea anyway.  So, this lightness and somewhat small size I can just as easily viewed as a plus as well a minus.I really expected headphones which has been manufactured for decades to come with an RCA phono-plug rather than a modern one.  While I find it probably handier to have a modern type plug on the headphones, I really think they should have included a phono-plug  adapter with it.I'm not going against the years' of reviews before mine.  The sound from these headphone are clear, crisp, and has a fine frequency range.  I seriously doubt you're going to find anything  better than these headphones when they're on sale.

The only two cons I would have are that 1) they could be more portable: the ""earpieces"" don't rotate, so when you compress everything down to its most portable size, it's still more of a sphere than a circle. 2) Yes, I know that open-backed speakers are known for better sound, but I've had people sitting next to me be able to identify the song I'm listening to because these things ""leak out"" so much sound. The main problem with this (other than embarrassing yourself or annoying the person next to you) is that they don't work very well for plane riding or anything where it's loud (It was extremely difficult to hear many of the low notes in songs while on the plane last week). Other than those two things, these things are great. Speaking of folding flat earpieces, one of my buddies used to have those similar sennheisers, (I probably spelled that wrong) and he used to lend them to me for a long time until I got these, but the spot where the wire went into the earpiece actually frayed to the point that that earpiece went dead!

"[1, 1]",1359072000,A140SPVDYIRXZA,"I had a friend order this for me a while back from a site and I must say they're still working great. Excellent, audiophile-quality headphones for a decent price. So far, they've held up incredibly well over the year or so I've had them. They're very light and they haven't fallen apart or cracked anywhere at all, but still glad to have the KOSS warranty to replace them if I need to. The carrying case is a bit small so do watch out for that, but they will fit with a bit of finagling. I am a 19 year old college student, so I'm on the go a lot. I keep them in my laptop bag and they fit right in. If I decide I want to be a tool and wear them around my neck, they're nice because they automatically adjust to their smallest headband size, so they fit around the neck more like a choker necklace. I also love getting looks from people. Some comments include:""I like your headphones.""""Those are some wacky ass headphones man.""""Those are nice how much did they cost.""""They sound amazing.""et cetera.Pros:-I personally love the 80's styling.-Fold really small and are very portable. (Duh)-Come with a carrying case that feels very high quality and protects them from me.-The ear cushions themselves do not feel like the cheap foam that I was expecting, they're actually closer to Tempurpedic mattress foam, but a bit less squishy.-They (used to) automatically adjust to your head size without even having to touch them. I'll explain below.-Of course, the best thing, they sound great.Cons:-They fold small, but not flat. The headphones are still as thick, when folded, as the diameter of the ear pieces and such. I really wish they folded flat, that would make these truly great.-They don't FEEL all that well made. (But have held up thus far)-Over the course of the year or so I've had them, the metal headband part has bent slightly, but I imagine it's from the times I've tried to fold them up too small, so be aware of that, I'll explain below.-They will make your ears ache after a while (an hour or so).Meh:-I don't like how small the carrying case is, if it wasn't so well made, I'd think I was going to rip the seams or something when putting my 'phones away. Actually, it's not the case itself that's too small, as I can fit my MP3 player in the bag as well, but the opening. It doesn't open very wide. Be careful not to snag anything when putting them away.-Price is pretty cheap, but not exceptional, but I can't complain.-They don't noise cancel, but they're not noise cancelling headphones. I put this here because it's both good and bad. I like hearing my music in peace, but I also like being able to talk to my friends without having to remove my left earpiece from my ear. So they're okay for that.-They have a comfort setting on the sides, it's a switch you have to work. No, it is not an electronic switch for ""bass boost"" or anything like that, so don't get all excited. It's a mechanical switch that basically pushes the pieces against your head tighter. If you have it on the light setting and you move/fold the 'phones inward though, it'll automatically jump to the firm setting I think. It's kinda gimmicky, but it does adjust the tension SLIGHTLY. This will not prevent them from hurting your ears after a long period.So, as you can see, my cons and such are mostly about certain ""bonus"" features of the headphones. As a pair of headphones, they're the best I've ever had.Okay, so as I wrote above, there are two things I have to elaborate on:-Self adjustment: When I first bought these headphones, I could hold one side with one hand and simply lower them onto my head, and they would self adjust like some piece of alien technology. Neat. Well, it's been a while and, while I do my best to take care of my technology, all the folding/unfolding of them, due to the nature of the design, has bent the headband slightly out of the almost-perfect circle it used to be in. It does NOT look any different aesthetically, but it inhibits the little self-adjusting magical fairy gnomes from doing their job as well as they did originally. And by ""little self-adjusting magical fairy gnomes,"" I mean ""those black things on the metal headband that guide it through."" Anyhow, not a huge deal, as it's still very easy to adjust.-Folding the headphones: As I've said above, the constant folding/unfolding of the headphones will (if you're not careful and you accidentally and repeatedly fold them up too tight without knowing) bend the metal headband to the point where it won't self-adjust as easily as it originally did. So, I'm going to help you figure out how to fold them, so you can avoid bending your pair on accident. Okay, so, it's pretty easy to do. The large plastic black pieces that hold the headphones fold inward. Fold them as if you were pushing them into your ears. They will swing into the center of the arc of the headphones about the little piece with the oval-shaped head cushions. Now, on each side of the hinge area, there is a loop and a hook. I don't remember which side is which, but you'll see it. It's the end of the metal headband. Hook the ends into the ends, and you'll have a nice neat circle. Now, you can move the little black slider pieces toward where you just hooked the headband to itself, but DO NOT GO TOO TIGHT. This is how you will bend them. I would say you can slide them about an inch and a half away from the hinge where the earpieces fold in. Now you should be good to go and they'll stay nice and folded.Anyhow, that's about all I have to say. These are well worth the money. I don't use them at home, because I have larger, more comfy headphones for that, but if I'm out? This is all I use. I generally hate earbuds, I always have, so this is how I listen to my music if I go out anywhere.","01 25, 2013",5.0,B00001P4ZH,Amazing headphones! Still working great!,M5000

The retro look reminded me of some old headphones I had that were much larger.  I suppose that is my fault though since they are sold as portables.Pros:The sound quality is great for portables.  They sound even better than some of the lower-end, ear-covering studio headphones that I have.  I have always liked Koss' attention bass response in their headphones.  The cord is just the right length for portable headphones at about 3 feet.  Don't get these if you like longer cords.  They fold up very nicely and compact.  It comes with a carrying case and 1/8 to 1/4 adapter.  They are pretty light and comfortable, though a little tighter on wider heads.Cons:They feel somewhat cheap and I imagine the actual hinge piece on the speaker driver snapping off over time (the speakers are on a two way hinge for comfortable fit).  My head is on the larger side (while not huge) and I find these headphones the most comfortable on their largest setting.  They don't seem to cater well to larger heads.

I wanted some good headphones to use in the late evenings when my kids are in bed, and I really wanted to LOVE the HD202s.  The reviews were great, the price was great, and they are ""Sennheisers"".

These current PortaPros are simply great headphones.  They are clear, free from distortion, the bass is all there and punchy, not boomy or muddy in the least.The best thing I can say about headphones is that they don't just ""sound good for headphones"", they produce a very good sound.  And these Koss have great sound - really, very excellent.To be objective - I don't think I'd be quick to let a child use these.  While the build quality feels good, these aren't made for rough handling.If you want some incredibly rugged excellent-sounding budget headphones to have around for kids to use on computers, mp3 players, portable DVD players, etc, you can't go wrong with the Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones.

I could not find a pair that could give me a wide spectrum of sound at a decent price. I do have a pair of Ultimate Ears MetroFi 150v that came pretty close to what I was looking for (they were a steal at $16.00 shipped from Dell). However, I needed a pair of headphones that were comfortable for extended periods and most of all sounded great. Well, after reading the reviews here I figured I would give these a try. I was shocked when I cranked up my iPod Touch with some Metallica and could hear ALL of the music without distortion. The Koss Porta-pros are very ""airy"" and do not cut off the world around you yet they produce a very clear and natural sound that is hard to find in any other headset under $75+. I am very picky about sound since I used to do sound engineering for a 8 piece band and got used to hearing a live, wide range of sound with detail that is very percise. The bass response with the Porta-Pros is natural and clean, the mids are natural and full and the treble is also clear and true. I am very pleased with these headphones and honestly the lifetime warranty sealed the deal. I remember when I was a kid in the early 70s. My father bought me a Koss headphone set (I cannot remember the model), but listening to the current top 40 music of the day from my simple record player, I remember how good those headphones sounded back then and how it would transport me into another world.

"[1, 1]",1327104000,AMGNNJWUEIJ59,"Have used these headphones for the past 6 months mostly for travel, including on airplane, with an mp3 player and also at home with my computer.  They are the best headphones I've tried, particularly at this price level, for sound quality.  On an airplane, they perform better than the noise cancelling headphones I've used because they maintain the full spectrum of sound without the muffling sound I've encountered with noise cancelling headphones.  Because of the low distortion, I've been able to turn up the volume without hurting my ears to get past airplane noise.  Also, there is little sound leakage so when you do elevate the sound level, the passengers next to you won't be bothered as much by loud music.  The headphones also fold handily so they are small enough to carry for portable use.  At home, the headphones perform with excellence on higher quality playback devices so they are useful when you want to listen to music by yourself.  I highly recommend these headphones.  If asked about the negatives, I would say there are 3 things:  the headband is a bit small and a bit difficult to adjust with the clip on metal - the design of these are old and this could be improved; the cord is shorter than one would like; and finally the earpiece is covered by foam like the old airplane headphones, which deteriorate over time (but fortunately you can buy replacement foam cushions here on Amazon very inexpensively and they are easy to replace.

I read the reviews that others gave and I thought ""they can't be THAT good,"" but for the price, I didn't have much to lose.Pros-Adjustable earpieces work surprisingly well; basically, it just gives you the ability to change how much pressure the headphones put on your ears. I find that my ears get sore with most headphones, but these are very comfortable.-The adjustable headband will fit any head size. I haven't got my hair caught in it yet.-They fold up for greater portability, and come with a very stylish leather bag (probably fake leather, not sure).-The sound is fantastic, better than anything in this price range. Clear mids and highs, and decent bass that doesn't sound distorted when I crank it.Cons-No manual/directions. They weren't that hard to figure out, but a simple sheet of paper with directions would have been nice. It took me a couple minutes to find out that you need to extend the headband, then clip together the earpieces, then retract the headband to make them small enough to fit in the bag.-I'm sure the foam earpiece covers will wear out, but luckily they sell cheap replacements.-The leather bag is quite small, and the headphones barely fit inside.Overall, great headphones. They do what they do, and nothing more. Perfect.**UPDATE, ONE YEAR LATER**: I accidentally pulled the cord out of my headphones.

"[1, 1]",1376092800,A2MML4TOL6Q7BG,"After spending some time creating various playlists on Spotify, I quickly realized that listening to all those wonderful selections through my laptop speaker just didn't do justice to any of the songs.  Being on a tight budget, I researched various budget-priced Bluetooth speakers and bought the JBL Flip.  The difference between the laptop speaker and the Flip was, needless to say, outstanding.  So I started listening to my playlists while working on the laptop and was quite happy to realize that I could turn up the volume quite high on the Flip without experiencing any distortion.  Unfortunately, my wife wasn't as enthralled as I was with my late night listening habit.  I tried listening to the songs with the volume turned down quite low, but lost the enjoyment of hearing all the details I could hear at a higher volume.  Still being on a tight budget, I researched budget-priced headphones and bought the Koss PortaPros.  I can't believe how much better the music sounds on the PortaPro compared to the Flip.  All the raves you read from other reviewers are true, but can you see my dilemma?  The Flip sounds better than the laptop, and the PortaPros sounds better than the Flip.  I'm now thinking that I will have to take out a home equity loan to move up to the next level.  For the time being, however, I'm extremely satisfied with the PortaPros and will continue to listen to my music at whatever volume I want without irritating my wife.","08 10, 2013",5.0,B00001P4ZH,"Bad, better, better yet",Mr Joel Mason

The Koss Portapros are great if you are using an I pod such device. The sound they give is very clear and crisp. I actually hooked them up to my Onyko 110 Rms surround sound system at 70 volume level and they did not blow they did crackle but these are not a stereo headphone but close.The Koss PortaPro is the best lightweight headphone for hearing all the great variety of pings and pongs with booms for the money. The displacement with these is incredible. The sound comes in so clear and uniform you almost think your in the studio but not quite. They are worth it.I bought the Pana...screw it look above.. ok.. These are great head phones the song displacement is no where near as good as the Koss. Koss has a lot higher range than the Panasonic. The Panasonic I think were designed to give a bigger bass with less treble in the high notes but they sound the best at the highest volume. I personally like that. You listen to music loud to get into it. So you have to listen to these cans loud to enjoy them. They are very good and better than AKG M80 MK11.. for the price(10 bucks cheaper that the Koss).So whos the best.The Koss Portapro got it down in the sound department and the construction is very good. Koss also stood up to my Stereo.The Panasonic sound muffled compared to the Koss but not that much. Panasonic also can be played on your stereo and they vibrate with bass on your head..this can be annoying though. The Panasonic are built though wires won't fall out and you can depend on them on a 110 rms system to deliver the better than paid price for the sound. They are ok no Sennheiser or Grado , Sony Mdr  sound quality.I choose the Koss for my Ipods and laptops... But I choose the Panasonic for a pretty good home surround sound system.  These are 2 different headphones. One is used for ipods and laptops the other is designed for everything. You like sound get Koss. You want everything with a lack in areas get the Panasonic.

Each headset has it's own distinct feature and advantage. Very frankly speaking, the portapro's price is what I believe Koss cashing in on the hype, since frankly speaking I do not see the 50% increase in any way.That being said, the portapros do sound the best of the lot, because it feels like it has a slightly wider soundstage. I guess that is since the sportapros have a solid plastic plate almost covering the speakers, hence kind of ""closing"" it up a bit. The KSC75 have it in them to sound as good as these two, but the lack of any pressure to hold the speakers closer to the ear result in most of the sound leaking out, hence the huge drop in bass. Press the speakers close to the ears with your hand and you'll get what I mean.Comfortwise, I would say the KSC75s win by a mile. You won't even feel that you have a pair of earphones on. The pads are good, comfy, and the same for all the three, but here the lack of pressure on the ears plays to the advantage of the KSC75s.Sportapros definitely look odd. The KSC75s look uglier. Love the design idea of the sportapro though, the conversion to a behind-the-head fit is genius, and definitely a worthy option given the metal band of both sportapro and portapro being always hungry for the hair follicles around it. The portas and the sportas both come with a nice faux leather pouch, in which you can curl both of them in to a cute little ball and toss in. the sportas came with a nice gold plated 3.5cm to 1/4"" adapter as well. Packaging wise, portapro is miles aahead of the rest (well they are almost twice as expensive as the sportapros!!). The KSC75s do not have any bells and whistles in the pack, but then again it's almost 1/3rd the price of portas.The only concern in any of the three headphones was the adapter of the KSC75s, which do not have any protective ridging for the wires coming out of it, make me skeptical about the longevity of the connection.The KSC75s are the best bang for the buck definitely. But again, even the most expensive PortaPro is less than half the price of it's closest competitor from another company.But seriously kudos to Koss for making some of the best headphones I've heard in my life and at prices the others can only go green on.","02 21, 2013",5.0,B00001P4ZH,"Comparison between PortaPro, SportaPro and KSC75",Nando

I did not find any portable headphone that delivers more sound.What makes this headphone so special is the dynamic it reproduces.The bass and treble that comes from this tiny package sounds like you are in front of a speakerwall.There are no words to describe the atmosphere it creates.When listening to classic music concerts its like you are there.When listening to a singer its like the stage is in front of you.When listening to pop, rock, disco, dancefloor, techno - you name it - it delivers the pump you would expect from BIG speakers.The clear vibrant trebles and the full deep bass it produces are just stunning.I still remember the first time I used those, the sound was so amazing it gave me this warm fuzzy feeling in the upper stomach area and left me speechless for a moment.Note that over time the earpads and the pads which are supposed to hold the headphone in place will wear out and eventually come off. This can be a major turnoff when you want to go jogging with it.I dont recommend wearing them long time or when you want to sleep (because of the pressure on the ears).The little blue ""comfortzone"" switch is supposed to set how firm the headphone is attached to your head.

When folded they are the size of a small apple.The headphone comes with a softcase.Summary:The speakers are not as compact as in-ear plugs but definitely have a better form factor than most pro headphones.The fact that mine are worn out after many years of usage but still used confirms that the sound itself is well worth the price.When listening - especially first time - be prepared to be left speechless.

There are really only two upsides to these headphones.  1)  They sound good, particularly in the low frequencies, and 2) they fold up small.  So what are the downsides?  1)  Any time you take them off they shrink back down to their original size.  You have to readjust them every time, which gets annoying fast.  2)  The things looks hideously ugly.  3)  Even though they have a setting to control how hard it squeezes you head, the pad above the speaker part rests on the side of your head and it will soon start digging into the side of your mellon.  Admittedly I have a larger than normal head, but these were very uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  I finally fixed this problem by bending the metal band out (a lot).  This modification made it so they don't fold up as small anymore.  4)  There is a hook above the right ear that you use to latch the headphones closed when stored.  This hook rubs on my ear if I'm not careful, which very quickly causes pain to the top of my ear.  5)  If the band adjusts while you are wearing the headphones there is a good chance it will suck your hair into the band which isn't a problem until you try to remove them, which quickly becomes unpleasant when you realize what has happened.  As a note, my hair isn't long, in fact I keep it with a military type crew cut, so this is a problem for anyone with head hair, regardless of length.Overall, given the choice to go back in time, I would have selected different headphones.

"[5, 5]",1168300800,A3P2RMAC6YQ51V,"I've had a terrible time finding headphones that I can wear for more than 5 minutes. First, I wear glasses, so that rules out a lot of ""over the ear"" headphones because it pushes the frames right into the sides of my head. The alternative, then, would be to use earbuds. I can't use earbuds though, because the insides of my ears are extremely sensitive due to multiple infections as a child. I didn't think I had an alternative. Fortunately, I came across these.For comfort, these things are a dream. I actually forget that I'm wearing them sometimes, which is a first for any headset I've owned. The pressure is applied above the ears as much as I'd like (it's adjustable) and I can change how much pressure is on my ears and the side of my head.Durability-wise, they *seem* to be fragile--specifically, the part where the speakers connect to the headphone frame--however I've often stuffed them in my coat pockets (yes, they're that small when folded up) where they've been squished against my shoulder bag and I've dropped them several times. It's all part of being a klutz. I have yet to do any damage to them, however. That's more than I can say about my portable MP3 player.Complaints: The bag seems a bit small, even with the ""correct"" way you put them in. I would've liked it if they made the opening a touch bigger so you could slip them in and out more easily. I've stopped using it altogether, but I use them every day for at least an hour so it doesn't matter too much for me.As for quality of sound, they've been excellent for me. I listen to a wide variety of classical, rock, and world music, and it's handled all of them quite well. I don't know how this would compare to, say, a $100+ headset, but for the price listed or under I think it'd have to be the best out there.

"[4, 5]",1265500800,A32LX4XJ2LU740,"I have been a Portapro enthusiast for the past 4+ years. You've already read the hundreds rave reviews of the Portapro's phenomenal sound and being that I am in agreement with them all, I have little to add. I have several head phones from different manufacturers such as AKG, Sony, and Sennheiser and these beat all the more expensive open air and closed air headphones I have. The only headphones that are better are in-ear variety which I use conditions with a lot external noise such as on planes and working out at the gym.However, recently I have fallen out of love with my Portapros and I think there are a lot of Portapro users who are in the closet about this particular design flaw that I'm about to elaborate on. First of all, let me explain that I have several mp3 players. Recently, I acquired mp3 players with large amounts of flash memory (16gb). Because of the long battery life inherent in these players (25 to 30 hours), I'm pretty much listening to them all day long, along with my Portapros. I wear these instead of the better sounding isolation earbuds because I need to hear the phone and be able to talk to people while wearing them.With my extended hours of usage, I've been noticing that when I remove my Portapros, about 7 times out of 10 they pull at least one of my hairs out. I have developed a method of slow removal combined with pushing together adjustable metal frame that reduces the instance of this. This acts to release any hairs that have been captured by the sliding mechanism. However, because many times, I have to answer the phone quickly, I find myself having to pull off the Portapros at more normal speed -- and this results in too many instances of unauthorized hair removal.Because of the great sound of the Portapro, I have been will to put up with it...until last night.Last night I was at Office Depot and on a whim I purchased the Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds (with the wind-up case) for about 10 bucks. These are the most generic basic earbuds that Sony makes. Over the years, I have owned several of these and my experience with them was that these were entry-level headphones with entry-level sound. But when I plugged them in, I was in for a pleasant shock. These sounded great. They must of done some design improvements since I last tried them. Excellent full spectrum sound for metal, jazz, classical -- everything I listen to. Tight, natural bass response that, in my opinion, is at least 97% of the greatness of the Portapro -- all for a measly 10 bucks. Better sounding than the other headphones I have that cost several times as much.Long story short...I've switched to Sony Fontopia's for the time being. The fact that they're not ""in the ear"" allows me to hear the phone and talk to people. But best of all -- no hair pulling.I still like the Portapros for their sound. In fact a week ago, I wrote an email to Koss explaining the problem and they politely explained they were working a solution that didn't compromise the positive qualities of the current design.That's cool. I'll be waiting. For now, I've hung up my Portapros. If there are other folks out there who have a problem with hair pulling like I did, the Sony Fontopia are a nice alternative for the being.Revision 2/28/2011In recent months, I've migrated back to using my Portapros. I'm just more careful when I take them off. There's nothing else like the sound on these babies. While I hope you guys fix the hair pulling, you're back to 5 stars.","02 7, 2010",5.0,B00001P4ZH,I'm back...the sound can't be beat!!!,"PositiveLogic ""Looking for Positive, Not Fear..."

Yo-Yo Ma sounds better with this compare to Sony.Even though this is supposed to be on the comfortable side of headphones, I still feel uncomfortable after using it for a while. I think it is the case for almost any headphone.However, this is not the best for conversation. I prefer my cheapo ear bud for Skype, which sounds a lot clearer. This is not a surprise since all telephones actually do filtration similar to that ear bud's frequency response to make conversations clearer and save system resources.By the way, I got a chance to try a Koss TD-80. This Portapro beats TD hands down in sound quality. If you enjoy music, but not on an AM radio or very compressed files, give this a try.Update: to improve the clarity in conversation (Skype) or vocal, I cut a hole in the center of the foam pad.

They were my first good pair of headphones and I still have a pair today.Back when I first got them I thought these were a god send. They simply blew me away. I had never heard a pair of cans with such deep detailed bass. But then again I was used to listening to the cheap stuff that came with Walkmans. So the Porta Pros were a big step up the food chain. More then twenty years later and about five different pairs (the thin wire constantly breaks)they sound a little bass heavy to me now. I now do most of my listening with a pair of Grado SR60's. Much better all around but twice as expensive. My first pair cost me about $50 and that was as in 1980's dollar's. So if you take into account their current price these head phones are a real steal.

Now I am wondering - what are people listening to?  The SportaPros sound so much better than the PortaPros that I have to believe something is wrong.  No depth or layering or punchiness to the PortaPros.  Portas are mostly defined by over-response in the treble range.  I'm getting sound out of both earpieces so there is not a missing channel.I've heard all about the ""burn-in"" for headphones, but the Sporta's haven't needed that and I'm not sure how much time to waste on these Porta's.  I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD238 which beat the heck out of the PortaPros but are somewhat on a par with the SportaPros.  Now the Senns seem to be sounding better with more use as I did not like them as well out of the box, but do now.  Or my ears are getting ""burnt-in"" to their sound as I think happens also.Is there something wrong with my PortaPros?  I have no idea why there would be such dramatically poor quality in a product which most people seem to rate higher or on a par with the other phones I have.** Update 1/28/11 - another thing with these phones - the channels are reversed!  Listening to ""All I've Gotta Do"" by the Beatles (old stereo, music one side vocals the other) I have 3 sets of headphones where the vocals are right channel and the music is from the left channel.  On these, it is reversed (and yes I do know how to put them on, triple checked etc).

I like my Klipsch, Sennheiser, Grados, etc. I dislike BOSE for the cheap materials, over-marketing business model. I'm annoyed by Beats headphones that are just Monster headphones with Dr. Dre's name and over-boosted bass tones - but sold in awesome bright colors. Hey, I respect that Beats is bringing attention back to cans, I really do, but they're not good sounding headphones.I have a nice pair of Sennheiser noise-cancelling headphones I can't always wear due to headaches from the noise cancelling feature. Also if I'm doing activities, the Sennheisers are huge and cumbersome, not practical if I'm running, washing my car, or otherwise moving about quickly. I have a great pair of Klipsch earbuds, and those are fantastic for running. But they have poor bass response.The Koss PortaPros are fantastic, almost mixing the best of both and leaving out the extras. It does not sound as nice as the either of the above mind you, but you won't be left complaining. The bass response will destroy those of any earbud-style headphone, but you know that. Koss' drivers are more than capable of handling the meager power they receive, and they do well to replicate bass from an on-the-ear design.The downside? Yes, the looks. Hey, they're not bright-colored pastels that scream ""LOOK AT ME!"" In fact, they are ugly and say ""stay the hell AWAY from me!"" but if you're not buying headphones for the image (and you really shouldn't be), then you shouldn't care. They look dorky for a reason, though: each side has a switch that allows you to set firmness, allowing the buds to ""flex"" outward. This makes for very comfortable wearing. So if you're not trying to impress the kids at your high school and instead want to save some money and get good sound, check out the Koss PortaPros.The best part is they're so inexpensive, if they ever do break or get lost, stolen, etc.... you don't care.

"[7, 7]",1237507200,A6FIAB28IS79,"Having recently sold my Sony MDR-V6 headphones (good cans but no longer practical for my purposes), I succumbed to the frequent hype surrounding the Koss PortaPros and ordered a pair, as a back-up to my Sennheiser PX100s and, if necessary, as a replacement.They certainly are no replacement, and I have yet to decide whether to keep them as a back-up.  Headphone judgments can be highly subjective, but here's one consumer's observations:1.  The PortaPros have a reputation as ""retro-stylish"" but providing cutting-edge, compensating sound quality.  My first impression upon wearing them, even before connecting them to a CD player, was that the comfort level is not equal to the PX100s.  I was highly conscious of an awkward tin band around my head and frankly baffled by the resistant 3-level ""Comfort Zone"" switch.  Admittedly, the initial sense of discomfort dissipated once the sounds of my player were picked up by the headphones.  They're indeed high efficiency (demanding less volume than the PX100s), producing an open, ""non-canned"" and transparent sound in the mid-range and offering  impressive detailing of the acoustic double bass on the low end as well as the drummer's ride cymbal on the upper end.2.  I began doing numerous A-B comparisons, noting that the PortaPros were immediately more arresting, producing bright, ""forward"" and ""instant"" reproduction of all frequencies, at times making me wonder if the PX100s weren't just a trifle muddy.  But soon the PortaPros began to sound slightly ""edgy"" and ""aggressive""-- less balanced in their overall sound compared to the ever-pleasing Sennheisers.  Then an Achilles heel became unmistakable on a CD on which the PortaPros began to break up on the notes of the double bass unless I backed off on the volume by 50%.  With the PX100s the same CD produced only the slightest hint of distortion, which vanished when I cut back on the volume by a mere 10%.  Soon I wearied of the comparison: the PX100s had won the argument, and rather convincingly at that.  They're slightly more cumbersome to fold up and reinsert in their hard case than the PortaPro's (at least without practice), but that slight downside had never seemed more insignificant.3.  Neither of the above headphones would be ideal for monitoring or DJ work near a microphone,  the PortaPros more so because of their extreme sensitivity, which would certainly invite feedback.  For that sort of work, I depend on the largely overlooked Koss UR40s.  For comfort, frequency range, balance, and long-term wearability I would take these full-sized (but extremely lightweight) headphones over not only the PortaPro and PX100 but the Sony phones mentioned above. The UR40s handled the overly ""hot"" bass with absolutely no incident or rollback requirement.  Their weakness is shoddy workmanship (I'm on my 2nd pair): the head webbing came detached after a couple of months' use and the conducting wire is both excessively thin and short.  (If you purchase either Koss, be sure to save all of the order materials to be able to avail yourself of Koss' famous lifetime guarantee).","03 20, 2009",3.0,B00001P4ZH,Koss PortaPro vs. Sennheiser PX100 vs. Koss UR40,Samuel Chell

"[1, 1]",1376179200,A1VY2CG81I1JRR,"I've been through so many headphones, and many have sounded fine (such as this set); however, what's the point of having a decent sound when the construction itself doesn't last more than a year?  Honestly, I think I'm done buying low-priced sets with their fragile construction.  And by this, I mean that (in 100% of the broken cans I've had) it's the wire connection to the plug.What bothered me the most about this set was that I never really used it in any aggressive manner.  It's just time and movement of any kind has weakened that connection.  It shouldn't be the case.Regardless, I'm late to the game on reviewing this product, so I don't expect to change anyone's minds.  If you're in the market for a cheaply made but decent sounding set of headphones to get you through a short-term period, this might be recommended.  For my part, I think it's time to spend more and shoot higher.","08 11, 2013",3.0,B00001P4ZH,"Good sound, poor construction",SingingDesigner
"[1, 1]",1266624000,A2EU4JERXUZDSI,"I came to these headphones after coming from $180 Shure E210 earbuds that broke and these headphones are certainly on par, if not better, than them.  I loved my Shure earbuds and I love these a heck of a lot more.  The sound quality is superb and while there have been complaints about the bass for some, it's definitely not a deal breaker.  Personally, I appreciate the little extra bass these give.  It's not overwhelming, but it is noticeable that these headphones have more bass than others.  There are two major things that people may be concerned with with this product:1) The adjusters at the top of the band catch a few hairs on your head and may pull a few out as they're being removed.  Having short hair is beneficial with these headphones, but if you have long hair, simply hold the adjusters in place as you remove them and remove them gently.  You'll have no problems otherwise.2) These headphones leak sound just like any other headphone of this type.  If this bothers you, you may want to look elsewhere.  The sound leakage isn't super loud or annoying, but if you're in a quiet room and listening to rock music at a moderate level, a person a few feet from you will notice you're listening to music.Otherwise, the sound, the comfort, and the price makes these headphones worth it for anyone who is looking for a great pair of headphones.  They easily stand up to headphones within the $150-$200 price range and sound just as good for a fraction of the price.  No, these are not too good to be true.  You won't be disappointed.","02 20, 2010",5.0,B00001P4ZH,Great headphones for a great price,sky58

"[17, 18]",1128384000,A3UI6CTFWL721L,"These headphones are an amazing value and very well designed. The headphones are small, yet the design is such that they firmly yet comfortably fit on your head. There is a small button allowing adjustment of how much pressure is exerted. The drivers are nicely padded and there are pads that sit on the temple, ensuring that the drivers sit parallel to the ears.The sound is superb, especially considering the size of the phones. The bass extension is very good and satisfying, much better than comparably sized phones. The overall sound is neutral and non-fatiguing so that you can listen to them for hours at a time without getting tired.One thing to note is that headphones typically are ""open"" or ""closed"" design. A closed design uses heavy pads to block out external noise and are meant for use in noisy environments. Open headphones, like the Koss PortaPros, are designed for use in quiet environments. So if you want phones for use in the subway or the airplane, these are not designed for that type of use.Another very important feature of Koss phones is the lifetime warranty. I have had my Koss PortaPros for over 10 years now. I have accidently snagged the wires and ripped one out. I sent them back to Koss with a check to cover the nominal shipping and handling charge(see their website for details), and they promptly refurbished my headphones, and even put on new pads to replace my old pads! Other manufaturers would have forced me to buy a new pair of phones. So if you expect your phones to take some punishment during use, the lifetime warranty is a big plus.Those interested in small, open style phones may also want to check out the Sennheiser PX100, which delivers similar performance, though the PX100 has less prominent bass and more mid-range; the typical Sennheiser sound. Both are excellent values but in my mind, the extra bass output and lifetime warranty make the Koss phones a slightly better deal.","10 4, 2005",5.0,B00001P4ZH,Excellent headphones for portable electronics,"S.

They do great bass simulation and I can hear instruments I can't detect on other headphones.  There are some downsides too but none of them are dealbreakers.  It has a weak size adjusting slider that can snag your hair and the dated 80's design is kinda ugly.  They have no noise cancellation, so sound will start to leak before my ipod reaches half volume, and for something called the Porta Pro, they aren't particularly portable.  They fold up, but they don't fit in your pocket.  Still,  you can't find a better lightweight pair of  headphones in this price range.

"[40, 44]",1083369600,A35TD8QAUMV0DB,"Take what other reviewers have said about these headphones, believe them, and then multiply it by 100. I received a pair of Koss UR-20s as a gift years ago and loved them  so naturally I looked to Koss again when replacing my portable/on-the-go headphones. After buying a pair of KSC-55s, which sounded great but were uncomfortable for me personally, I hopped on Amazon and found everyone raving about the PortaPros. I figured they were good, especially considering that the design seems unchanged since the 1980s (which has to mean something), but I also figured that this was one of those things that was just too good to be true. However, these are bar-none the most amazing headphones I have ever put on my head. Listening to some of my favorite songs for the first time was one of those 'wow' moments where you realize you have found something that changes your expectations completely. The bar will be raised the instant you hear the bass response and incredible acoustic qualities of these light, comfortable headphones.I don't know what I'm impressed with the most: the amazing bass, the excellent stereo division, or how loud they can get! These things are just as amazing as most of the reviews show them to be and then a lot more... I was worried about the eighties styling, but in person they don't look bad at all. I hate headphones that scream for attention, but these don't look like that when you have them on and I have already been wearing them in public (something I didn't think I would do after only seeing the picture of them online). And even if they're a bit outdated in appearance, the design is so functional you won't even give looks a second thought after you put them on.One thing is for sure: these things have plenty of bass! Not too much (not ""boomy""), but they seem properly tuned for listening to things without ""bass booster"" turned on, which I like. Even with the bass settings adjusted high, the bass remains clear and crisp. I'm not sure how much power these can handle without damaging them, but I listen to them very loud and they do not sound distorted or stressed at all. After a few days my left speaker began making some weird noises and it ended up being a hair stuck inside the headphones that I cleared out with canned air. Something important to consider is that these are very open and airy headphones and the treble carries very well outside the headphones (so someone nearby could definitely hear what you're listening to if you have the volume up loud).Others have mentioned that they felt the headphones were too tight feeling, but I have a very large head and they fit me without a problem. However, if I will be wearing them for an extended period of time I always set them to the ""Light"" setting on the comfortZone control (which divides the side pressure of  the headphones with your temples rather than just on your ears).I already had headphones I was pleased with (Sony MDR-G52s and Koss UR-20s) but I wanted a set of small, portable headphones for use with my laptop and these are perfect. The folding design isn't something I necessarily wanted, but it is nice. The carrying case they come with (a leatherette bag) is a slightly tight fit and I probably won't end up using it much since it is not a hard case that would protect them from shock or crushing. Some others have mentioned that they feel delicate or are easily broken, but compared to other small headphones I have had they seem very well built and equally strong considering their light weight.While I wouldn't say these are bad things about the PortaPros, it is worth mentioning that the headband is metal and will occasionally snag a hair as you adjust it on your head, and that they don't fold down as small as you might think they would so don't expect to put them in your pants pocket or something. Considering these are the worst things I can come up with to say about the PortaPros, they are nearly perfect in my book.I can't say enough good things about these PortaPros! They're simply amazing. These are the first headphones (or speakers) I've had that sound absolutely awesome without adjusting the equalizer or pumping up the bass. They sound good on everything from R&amp;B to Country and everything in-between. I've been especially impressed that they pull the bass and highs out of a song without getting that shrill, tinny treble that plagues so many headphones. If there ever was a question about the quality of Koss stereophones in my mind, these PortaPros have put it to rest and made me into a lifetime customer!

"[1, 1]",1361750400,A3JN3KKON08QBM,"I bought these headphones after my Koss earbuds finally developed a short after many years of use. I stayed with Koss because I had been very satisfied with these earbuds as a significant improvement over the apple earbuds for an ipod. And I was hoping for a bit of an upgrade with these headphones. But I didn't expect this significant an upgrade. When I first listened to them I was a bit overwhelmed by the bass. I had some concerns with an overly heavy bass because of some reviews mentioned this. But the more I listened, the more I loved it. I was simply hearing the bass in a way I had been missing with my earbuds. And I mostly listen to jazz with these headphones so it's not like I'm looking for a heavy rock bass here. I was just very happy to hear the bass as well defined as it was with these headphones (right now Gary Smulyan's baritone sax sounds amazingly full!).. And the rest of the sound is excellent as well. My only regret now is I'm getting used to this much bigger sound so I'm less blown away by what I'm hearing than when I first made the upgrade. But I have only to listen to some earbuds to get that &#34;wow!&#34; feeling again.Another feature which attracted me to these headphones which didn't dissapoint is their portability. I like to take my earbuds/headhones with me when I travel and don't want to lug big headhones around which take up a lot of space. These headphones fold up into a kind of ball which almost fits in the palm of my hand. And they're very comfortable to wear. The &#34;comfort zone&#34; settings come in very handy. Moving the setting from &#34;firm&#34; to &#34;light&#34; makes a difference you can easily notice in how the headphones feel. I find that I prefer the setting right between the extremes (there are three settings in all).So, unless you've got something against '80s style and are concerned that you're just going to look too wierd with these things on, they are the perfect listening device to use with an ipod (or, at least, that's what I use them with) that combines great sound and portability.","02 25, 2013",5.0,B00001P4ZH,Best headphones since sliced bread!,Steven Hendley

"[5, 5]",1260662400,A2VV9CK8ZN1DQQ,"I am most certainly not an audiophile but these headphones came highly recommended not only from other sites but from other people I know. They are a classic design from the eighties which is now nouveau chic again.I am a heavy heavy tech user and like to use high quality items and I demand a lot from them.With that said these are my new favorite headphones (the one's that travel with me everywhere).I was skeptical even after reading all the reviews, thinking ""How could something so reasonably priced really be as good as all of these reviews suggest."" Well they can be and are, consider my doubts banished as I was pleasantly surprised. The reviews are correct, this is Koss' masterpiece, homerun, the epitome of what Koss represents.I have a pair of Bose Triport Headphones and Senneheiser PX200's both of which are excellent headphones....and these Porta Pros are commandingly better (the Triports are ""warmer"" and the Senneheisers crisper, but I like the sound of these best as they are the cleanest clearest balance of warmth & crispness).They are light weight, foldable, exceptionally comfortable and of coarse the sound quality is excellent.Actually, I cannot say enough about the sound quality, it is well balanced, full, hits the highs, lows and everything in between accurately. They produce clean scratch that pristine audio that is a pleasure to listen to. I find myself searching out music that can challenge or push these and they just keep on producing beautiful music to my ears.Essentially they are awesome. (period) They sound and function better than headphones easily two or three times their price, look cool if you're into retro and they are dirt cheap.CONCERNS:The only concerns if any are that the part that connects the earpiece to the headphone part doesn't seem very robust and may break eventually(though I haven't had any issues). Some may find that the metal headband might catch on their hair (something else I haven't had an issue with, though I have short hair) and finally, the foam pads over the earphones sort of scream I'm cheap and I will wear out on you. In defense of them, it does keep with the whole retro thing, it's really comfortable, it's easily replaceable, and they are in fact inexpensive, essentially who cares. Many of these small things have been ever so slightly adjusted on the Anniversary Edition of these gorgeous nearly perfect headphones (but for twice the price I wouldn't bother).

And what it basically comes down to is value.  I have never heard sound as good as these headphones in the $35 range, easily the best under $75.  I can't believe they're over 25 years old.It's hard to describe how much detail these headphones bring out without making it too harsh or dull.  I listen to every type of music from classical to hip hop to electronic to country, and these headphones are suitable for all types of music.  The only fault in the sound is the bass.  It's just a *slight* bit boomy, but you get to like it after a while to be honest.The design is from the 80s as you all have probably figured out.  It could use a update but it seems like Koss has tried to perfect this formula and failed in the past.  I don't really care about the looks or the way it folds up or the fact that my hair gets caught up in it (I have very short hair, even for a male).But despite it's design flaws, it's the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, and the best part is that it's also the best sounding pair of headphones I have ever heard under $75.If you can get over the design flaws or if sound is the most important feature of headphones for you, there is nothing even close to this at this price range.This one is an absolute GEM.  I loved these so much I ordered two of the 25th Anniversary ones for a bit more.Update: I read some reviews about the PX100-II being much improved and better sounding than the PortaPro.  Since the PX100-II is relatively new, I thought I'd give it another listen.  This time I noticed something different.  The sound is warm, mellow, and neutral, but it loses a lot of detail at the expense of these attributes.  I still prefer higher-detail Portapro, but some may prefer the more mellow sound of the PX100-II.Oh by the way the Portapro comes in the straight plug now, not the angled plug anymore.

I'm comparing them to the Sony MDR-V6, which in my opinion rates against headphones in the $200+ price range.The PortaPro is not a bad headphone, but its not a good headphone either. The bass is present but muddy. Not clear or crisp at all. The mids have a decent amount of detail but the muddy bass bleeds the mids out quite a bit. And the treble.... where is it? I haven't heard a headphone with less treble. This lack of treble futher leads to the overall lack of detail and excitement found in other headphones. Are they worth the $25 that I paid? Yes. But I wouldn't pay more than that for them. Save up and buy the ~$67 Sony MDR-V6, its several tiers above the PortaPro, not only in sound quality, but in noise isolation and build quality.

"[1, 1]",1347580800,A2E4ROH3UVXCEJ,"My old Sennheiser PX-100s were finally dying after about five years and it was time to find a new pair of jogging/traveling around headphones. The PX-100s were great, but with the success of that product Sennheiser changed the headphones somewhat and jacked up the price so I figured it was time to tryout their Koss counterparts. I'm a big fan of the PortaPros, they have punchy bass, mid-range is good and the treble is not too piercing. The result is a very good product, though I have to admit I don't like the sound quite as much as the Sennheisers. I think that the main problem is the bass, it's good, but the Sennheisers had a dynamic, fat bass sound that the PortaPros can't quite reach.  I'm a fan of a variety of music, and in rock and jazz tunes this slight deficiency is not apparent at all. With electronic music and, in particular, hip-hop, the limits of the bass show up. I should say that I do have perhaps an over-fondness for low-end sounds so it's possible that you'll like the fact that the bass isn't as strong with the PortaPros.  I will also say that while I don't like these PortaPros quite as much as the PX-100s, I don't think that the PX-100s are worth their new $50 price tag and I would purchase these Koss headphones again if giving the choice.","09 14, 2012",4.0,B00001P4ZH,Great Headphones for a Great Price,Tyler

The bass is surprisingly decent for those few songs that need it.  I like the open ear design for use at work as I can hear when people are talking to me.  The whole package is much smaller than it seems in the pictures with the ear pads just barely covering my ears.My biggest complaint is with the portability, or rather the compromises made for that portability.  They fold up decently small and very easily.  This ease means that all adjustments that you make are immediately reset when you take the headphones off your head, even for a second.  Since I use these at work, I just keep them at my desk and don't need them to fold up.  I'd rather that they didn't so I could adjust them exactly how I want and never have to bother again.EDIT October 2013: I've had these since July 2011 and they still sound great, but I have run into a few issues.-They tend to unfold in my bag if I take them with me.  Not a big deal, but it tends to tangle the cord when that happens.-The plastic pieces that hold the two halves of the metal headband together started to unsnap and fall apart.  It was annoying to keep putting them back together, but some superglue has fixed the problem.-After 1.5 years, the cushions have fallen apart.  They're pretty thin to begin with, so no real surprise, and replacements are under $5 for three pairs, but kind annoying.Still, I'd buy another pair if I had to.

I listen to death metal, classical, jazz, classic rock, trance, ... and these do all of them justice. Mid-range guitars don't sound muddy, bass is punchy (could be a bit bass heavy for some) and highs are not screechy at all.The thing is, the design hasn't changed a whole lot since the 80s when they were first introduced. They are open-air headphones, meaning that they leak sound...both ways. So don't wear these on a subway or in a loud area, as they do not block out sound at all.The adjusting mechanism hasn't affected my hair as much as others here, but it is still an issue. Extend the phones beyond your head size, then adjust down. This way your hair won't get pulled out as often.The cord is pretty thin and the plastic construction means that you gotta be pretty careful with them; I've knocked them around a bit in my jacket pockets and backpack though and haven't had any problems.With regards to comfort, I wear glasses, and many other headphones press my ears to my head so hard that my glasses indent the sides of my face. Not comfortable at all. These, thanks to those weird-looking comfort pads above the &#34;ear&#34; pads, don't.Other headphones tend to make my ears heat up.

"[2, 2]",1297123200,ARM4MTNZK1975,"I've owned many different headphones before, including aSony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil(an incredible headset in its own right) and listened to some high end sets that friends have including a set of AKG K701 Studio Headphones, and these are, easily, my favorite. I will always love my Sony MDR-V6, but due to a recent change in my listening needs, I needed a pair of open cans, portability being a huge plus. I considered the Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone but those didn't really look very comfortable, and aren't particularly portable. I gave these a shot, and considering their price and heritage, why the heck not?I have absolutely nothing but praise to say for these cans. They are amazingly comfortable, probably the most comfortable set of cans I own. The ComfortZone system really works, and allows you to balance pressure between the ear pads and head pads. Why Koss or another company hasn't implemented this system in newer sets is beyond me, it allows you to releive the pressure on your ears when your just kicking back and listening, or increase the pressure when you're moving around. Of course, these aren't sport phones and are less than optimal when you're very active, for that I would recommend the less comfortable but acoustically similarKoss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones. I haven't found the headband to be uncomfortable at all, but I do have quite the thick dome of hair protecting it. You might think this would cause the hair pinching problem some have complained about, but I haven't had that problem yet. The portability is respectable, they do fold up into, as someone says, a pokey baseball. The case is pretty worthless and too small, but whatever, its really not necessary. The looks, well, are subjective. I think they're very unique and in a way personify the anti-""Beats by Dr. Dre"" look, which in my book is a great thing, but most normal people might not agree. Who cares what they think :)And of course, the most important aspect, the sound quality. I find these sound absolutely excellent. The response is geared more towards listening pleasure and not flat response, so these won't be any good at studio monitoring or mixing, but they also don't need a ton of EQ adjustments to make listening enjoyable, unlike my V-6's. Personally I only bring up the extreme lows and highs just a little bit, and they sound great like that. Very detailed, bright, punchy, and excellent response across the entire spectrum, except for the extremely low end of the spectrum. To get solid response in the sub-20Hz region, you're probably going to have to find a closed set or a set with larger drivers. It just comes down to the limitations of physics at that point. Other than that, the sound is amazing, there's really nothing else to say. Just make sure to give them a good long break-in period.A word of warning I should mention, is not all of them come from the factory in perfect working condition. The first set I had poor bass in the left channel, in about the sub-100Hz range. This is one of those defects that's hard to detect since bass isn't directional, and for awhile I though maybe I was going crazy. I was able to isolate this by listening to each side individually (by pulling the other away from my head) and was able to deduce the problem with the left channel perfectly using that method. Amazon was great about the replacement, and my new set is perfect.My only criticism about these cans would be the way Koss packs them. They wrap the chord up so tight I doubt the kinks will ever fully come out. I observed the same quirk with the KSC-75, Koss needs to either start wrapping the chords less tight or use a more pliable rubber in the chords. This annoyance is really the only indicator of how affordable these really are. Replacing the chords with a better quality set would probably be a worthwhile mod, and one I'm considering doing. Then again, that would probably void the excellent lifetime warranty.Overall, these are an amazing set of cans. There really is no excuse whatsoever not to give them a try; they've been made the same way for over 25 years, and once you use them, you realize why they shouldn't ever change a thing. They're a true legend, and even if the price was double what it is, they would still easily be worth the money. Recommended without any reservation whatsoever.Oh and a note about the photos, the actual plug is a gold-plated straight plug, unlike the steel right-angle plug in the picture.

The drivers can be easily detached and attached to KSC75's clips! This combination turned out to be very comfortable. Why not just buy cheaper KSC75 then? Well, the sound of PortaPro drivers is a step up. Unlike some other reviewers state, as far as I can tell, the PortaPro drivers are the same as KSC35 and NOT KSC75. They do sound different (to my ear), with PortaPro/KSC35 being more detailed and crisp but still retaining rich, warm, bassy (is there such a word?) sound I like so much about KSC75.

Love this little Koss and highly recommend it.","06 16, 2014",5.0,B00001P4ZH,amazing little headphone!,"X. kuang ""JK"""

I literally wear them out in about a year and a half of heavy daily commuting use. The great thing is if you catch the cable on something or drop the ear pieces and they start buzzing or break something, they come with a lifetime warranty and you can send them in to Koss and they will send you a replacement all for $6. I have done this about 5 times in 9 years. Try that with Sennheiser!!","06 20, 2009",5.0,B00001P4ZH,Porta Pro Rocks,Yal

Quality, easy to wear, they don't give you that feeling that you want to throw them because your ears won't hurt!","03 25, 2011",5.0,B00001P4ZH,"Great shape, lightweight, good sound.","zachimum ""Genevieve"""
"[2, 2]",1348185600,A7I6IEAQZIT9D,"First, these are not intended for loud places. You should be using these for a study, or library reading etc- not in a busy loud place. These are in no way intended for blocking noise- you will end up turning them up loud, and hurt your ears. But anyway, these are nice. Found em via Cnet. Easily fold up, but don't realy fit in the bag- i never have really needed it. As for comfort, you can't even tell they are there. As for sound- great highs, and not bad lows- all around goodness. Lifetime warranty was the selling point for me- i have already gone through about 10 or so pairs of the cheap skull candies- i would rather have something i could depend on. Just 9 or so bucks to ship and a new pair- i haven't had to do it yet, but it is there when i need it. All and all, awesome.","09 21, 2012",5.0,B00001P4ZH,Great sounding and comfy,ZCorriveau
"[2, 2]",1251504000,A4CIAXJTZ6P1,Awesome low freq definition. Highs are equally good. For the price ..its absolutely unbeatable. Haven't yet found anyone beat these old babies.
