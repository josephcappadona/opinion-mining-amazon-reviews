A1G25CG7UWQ3XO,B000TG4BA0,&#10003;Onodageg,"[0, 0]","I have been using a Dell Bluetooth notebook mouse for over a year. I elected to try this one because of Microsoft's reputation and because it was on sale.Pros--Comfortable for a small mouse-Responsive movement.Cons--bad battery life - my Dell lasted 2-3 months, this lasts about 2 weeks.-No forward button -my Dell has both forward and backward buttons-No visual indication it's on -the red on other mouse assures you it isn't dead. (though I realize laser's aren't visible-how about another LED???)-No confirmation of connection -other bluetooth items flash the blue light (or something) that let you know it's connected when turned on. It does glow green when you use the power switch to turn it on.-VERY SLOW to connect when dormant. When I first 'wake-up' the mouse after sitting, it can take over 20 seconds to connect. My Dell mouse seldom took over 5 seconds.-scroll wheel center button is too sensitive. I'm always clicking the center button by accident when scrolling and it's annoying.This time last year there were very few choices of a bluetooth mouse for a laptop and all were expensive. There are now more choices and the prices are coming down (a little late in my opinion). I never liked the RF dongle sticking out of my laptop and ending up breaking one before deciding to go bluetooth. My laptop has it built in, so why not use it?If you get a good price on this one and aren't trying to game with it you will be ok. Otherwise wait for the next model.",3.0,Almost a good bluetooth mouse,1221523200,"09 16, 2008"

My favorite parts are the fact that I don't have to carry a separate dongle to get mangled, and the fact that it has an on/off switch so that it doesn't run the batteries down in transit from inadvertent button pushes.  Works on nearly every surface, fits my hand well, and is very responsive.  I use it with an ASUS netbook, and it picks it up instantly whenever I turn it on.

First, I wish there was a right side button to complement the left side button so that I could navigate back and forth on browsers. The most damning problem, however, is the extremely poor battery life this mouse has.

A29L0NIWBAGELM,B000TG4BA0,Adam Van Pelt,"[0, 0]","I purchased this mouse a little over two years ago when I bought my MacBook Pro.  All-in-all, it has served me pretty well, but some of the annoyances I have with it have finally driven me to look for an alternative.I love the fact that it's a bluetooth mouse and thus doesn't require having any dongles plugged into my MacBook Pro in order to use it.  I never installed any of the software for the mouse because, quite frankly, I don't need any of the ""bells and whistles"" that mouse software typically provides.  For all I know, Microsoft doesn't have any Mac software for the mouse anyway, but I haven't looked into it.  On the positive side, I can also say that the mouse tracks very accurately, in my experience.However, the two things that have finally driven me to look for a new mouse are the battery life and the fact that this thing disconnects more often than not of late while I'm in the middle of using it.  First, about the battery life, be prepared to have plenty of AAAs on hand and in your backpack so that you're not left unable to use the mouse when it runs out of juice.  This thing takes two AAAs, and using this mouse for anywhere between eight and twelve hours a day most days, I can only get about two to two and a half weeks out of the batteries typically.  I've tried Duracell and Energizer. . .brand has made zero difference.I've put up with the battery life issues since I've had the mouse (and don't want to think about how many dozens of batteries I've gone through in just over two years.)  The thing that has been driving me nuts for the better part of two months is that I can be using this mouse with fresh batteries and all of a sudden, my mouse cursor will be dead in the water.  The first few times it happened, I thought my computer had frozen.  However, I quickly discovered that with a quick roll of my finger across the touchpad, the cursor jumped back to life.  Usually, all I have to do to wake the mouse up again is to move it across the mousepad three or four times and then I'll see the message on my screen that the mouse has connected once again.  Sometimes, the mouse only disconnects while I'm using it once a day, and sometimes it does it four or five times in one day.  I'm fine with it going to sleep when I'm not using it and waiting for it to wake up when I return to my computer, but disconnecting while I'm in the middle of moving the mouse is unacceptable.This is the only mouse I've ever used with this laptop, so for all I know, maybe my bluetooth stack has gone crazy on me, but I tend to think that's probably not the case.  I'm running OS X 10.6.3 with all of the latest updates installed as of this writing.  Even if the issue is with the bluetooth stack or the bluetooth radio on my machine, I'm looking at getting rid of this mouse so that I can stop going through AAAs like crazy.  I'm strongly considering theLogitech VX Nano Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks (Black)based on the positive reviews it has on both Amazon and Newegg.  I know that I'll have to have a dongle plugged in to one of my USB ports in order to use it, but it's a good trade-off for me if I can get a reliable mouse that sips the battery power as opposed to chugging it down.",3.0,I've used this mouse for two years.

Amazon confirmed the order via e mail. The Amazon confirmed by e mail that they shipped the item via USPS and provided a tracking number. When I track through Amazon it says ""in transit"". When I track at USPS it says the tracking number produces no results. The I get an e mail saying the item is out of stock. So how can it be ""out of stock"" and ""in transit"" at the same time. Customer service at Amazon tells me they do not charge the credit card if the item has not shipped. So, a couple of week later, my money is gone, I have no mouse, and I cannot get any help from Amazon customer service.Update: I finally re ordered the mouse directly from Amazon. I got the second mouse in a reasonable time frame. It has two problems. It goes through batteries way to fast (try 2 days of lite use) and it constantly looses connection with the computer even when 3"" away.

ALU9KVONG3TUM,B000TG4BA0,Alexandre Grigoriev,"[0, 0]","I could not make it connect with Dell Inspiron running Windows 7 x64  - Windows was finding it, installing the drivers, and then it instantly disappeared. Each connection attempt was creating a new device instance in the registry.The culprit was the WiFi adapter. Bluetooth and WiFi a/b/g/n occupy the same 2.4 GHz band and create mutual interference. Some combo WiFi/BlueTooth host chips employ special patterns of frequency hopping to make sure WiFi and BT don't transmit at the same frequency at the same time. This laptop doesn't seem to have that, but there are some settings enabled by default for the WiFi adapter to reduce the interference.I disabled the WiFi in the device manager for pairing the devices. After that, I reenabled it and the mouse was still working. I also set WiFi transmit power to medium, instead of high.EDIT TO ADD: The mouse may stop working occasionally (and then stop working at all). The solution for this problem: open Device Manager, find your BlueTooth adapter, open its properties on Power tab. Uncheck ""Allow Windows to turn off this device to save power"", click OK. If the BT adapter is hanging off internal USB (to see if it is, check View->Show devices by connection), you may want to do the same for the internal USB hub to which the adapter is connected.",3.0,Interference with WiFi prevents initial pairing,1385510400,"11 27, 2013"

The first couple of days were good because it connected automatically; however, whenever I restart my computer or the mouse falls in a deep sleep, I have to turn it off and on again, sometimes multiple times, for it to work again. This is pretty annoying, so it's definitely not perfect. My computer shows connected and everything so I don't think it's on the computer end.

You might have to put your wifi on a different channel if you experience any connection issues. I haven't. Also, turn off ""Allow bluetooth devices to wake this computer"" in the bluetooth menu under system preferences. Otherwise it will wake your computer up in the middle of the night.

A8UDAWGESVQQ,B000TG4BA0,AL,"[0, 0]","Initially I thought this mouse was too small and I had doubts about bluetooth in general. However it is very comfortable in my hand and bluetooth works reliably. It does go to sleep when not used, but wakes up very quickly. The wheel button makes a clicking noise when rotated, which I don't care for, but I'm sure I could get used to it. However, if I rotate upward, it clicks much louder. I find that irritating. And I find that I frequently end up depressing the wheel button (and activating autoscrolling) when I was just trying to rotate. But the deal breaker is the back button. The back button is hard to press, doesn't always make a clicking noise, and doesn't always work. And sometimes it makes a groaning noise.  I don't know if I got a bad one or if they are all like this. But mine is going back.EDIT----I exchanged it for a Logitech V470 and immediately noticed two things.First, the Logitech mouse doesn't slide as smoothly across my desk as the Microsoft mouse. I don't use a mouse pad. The Microsoft mouse slid smoothly and felt great. The Logitech mouse felt like dragging your finger nails across a chalk board. The more I used it, the more I dreaded the feeling.Second, there was a noticeable delay between when I moved the mouse and when the pointer moved on the screen. This was MOST irritating. I realize that Logitech specifies Broadcom/Widcomm hardware and stack, but Microsoft has no such restriction. I have ISSC hardware and Blue Soleil stack. I have what I have and there is no delay with the Microsoft mouse.Other than that, I thought the Logitech mouse was better. I preferred the larger size, the AA batteries, the tilt wheel, the quiet turning wheel, and the shiny blue housing. I think the battery cover design is more rugged. The buttons definitely have a louder click, but I have no preference either way.I decided to choose bad over worse, sent the Logitech back and now have two Microsoft 5000's. My original one definitely had a defective back button. These two work fine. However, one has a wheel that clicks very loudly when turned (just like my original one), but the other one does not.  The quiet one has an August 2009 build date while the noisy one has a May 2009 build date. I guess Microsoft made some improvements. I think I can live with them until something better comes along.",4.0,Bad Back Button and Wheel,1256947200,"10 31, 2009"

It not much smaller than the Logitech Blue travel mouse but it feels much smaller and cheaper and with sharp lines where there should be smooth curves.

I tried setting it on the computer at night so the BlueTooth link needed less power but life (of the battery) is short.

I keep trying to find a better one, but the rest of them inevitably fail worse than this one at some point.The Pros:The mouse will last forever.The buttons are responsive, and nice and clicky.Tracking is accurate.Stays connected fairly well.It has a pretty decent shape and weight.The Cons:Has a clicky (not smooth scrolling) scroll wheel which feels cheap.Chews through batteries every two weeks.Batteries are difficult to get in  and out.Almost impossible to wake up.So far this is the least sucktacular of any bluetooth mouse I've used on a Mac, which isn't saying much.  I don't know why no one can make a decent bluetooth mouse, but apparently it is impossible.  The above pros are self explanatory so let's get down to brass tacks:This thing eats batteries for lunch and dinner.  Bluetooth mice are known for this, so it is not a surprise, but the worse part is how difficult the batteries are to get in and out.  To get them out you rely on (what appears to be) a nylon tab.  it is too short, thin, and the battery compartment is too small (AAA) to easily remove batteries.  It takes small fingers and a considerable amount of fiddling to get ahold of each tab to pop it's respective battery out.  Then, when replacing the batteries, the tabs get in the way, and the batteries do not positively click into place.  It often takes some massaging to get the battery to make contact.  Again, if the batteries lasted longer than two weeks this would be a minor inconvenience, but as it is, it's a real pain.This mouses worst sin, however is that it is VERY difficult to wake up.  Most bluetooth mice will only take a click or two to wake up.  I could be banging this one on the wall for a solid minute before it will wake up.  It is very frustrating.  It doesn't fall asleep quickly (hence the big appetite for batteries), but when left for ten minutes or so, it will rip van winkle on you, leaving you to click wildly for a solid minute before hurling it across the room in frustration.Other bluetooth mice I have used and given up on:Apple Magic Mouse -bluetooth connectivity on this mouse is fantastic, I just hate it as a mouse.Razer Orochi - this mouse is pretty solid and wakes up easily, unfortunately it's a narcoleptic, and catnaps after only 2 seconds of inactivity which is posatively maddening.Logitech MX 1000(?)

I'm not sure if this was intended or not, but I prefer the hard click on both.

It is inevitable and imperative a child learns the hand-eye coordination required to perform such complex tasks and at this time in history if kids do not learn to incorporate a computer into their learning they will be behind by the time they enter first grade.The mouse fits well into my three year old daughters hand and she has an easy time guiding the cursor around the screen. This is only day one so I cannot comment on battery life although the pairing was instant and hassle-free. I can mouse precisely about 25 feet away THROUGH A WALL! I cannot emphasise adequately how amazed I am at this feat. Albeit there are fresh batteries in the mouse and that probably will become less amazing as they drain but for now, wow.The mouse will repair with the PC running Win 7 64bit Ultimate in about 2 seconds after I flip the power switch to on and move the mouse around (after the initial pairing of course). I have the tinyIOGear USB 2.1 Bluetooth Micro Adapter GBU421sold on Amazon as well as aBluetooth HID Wireless Keyboard Mouse Control for PC, Mac, iPad, iPhone 4, PDAswhich has a mouse built into top right corner with left and right click buttons on upper left corner which is good for an HTPC, but the mouse is not for little hands trying to work with tux paint and such. I love this combo.I like the back button but wish it had a forward button also (it looks like there is one there but it is just part of the frame. It would have been nice is all).Batteries are easy to install from bottom and cover appears sturdy getting batteries out is another issue. It appears they placed some kind of a plastic flexible tab to help you pull out the batteries, however it is too short to get a grip on to help you get the batteries out unless you have extremely dainty fingers or even those of a child. Even if you keep tension on the tab while inserting the batteries you still need a jeweller's screwdriver or pair of needle nose pliers to grab the tab and lift it. But we will see just how long the battery life lasts.My only other tiny complaint is that the scroll wheel button, like many mice I have owned, tends to require too light of a touch to push the third mouse button. I find trying to scroll and accidentally hitting the speed scroll option instead. I will get used to it though.

I was just going to get another Nano but thought why not try a bluetooth mouse since I paid extra to have built-in bluetooth support on my Dell laptop?  I am extremely glad I did.  I have had it for exactly 1 year now and am ready to share my experience.PROS:- No transceiver necessary, freeing up a USB port- Ergonomic design for either hand- Back button- Comfortable, responsive scroll wheel- On/Off button- Low battery indicator- Reliable connection- Nice solid feel- Looks nice- No driver or software install required (or offered)- Compatible with Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7/Mac OS X- Supported by Microsoft's great hardware warranty for 3 yearsCONS:- Somewhat short battery life- Doesn't automatically turn off to save battery- AAA batteries difficult to remove when replacing- Connection doesn't always reconnect when resuming from sleep modeNext to the scroll wheel, a back button is a mouse feature I cannot live without.  Many mobile mice do not include a back button so it was easy to narrow down my choices.  Guess how many mobile bluetooth mice have a back button?  Try 1.  The Microsoft Notebook Mouse 5000 was the only one I could find.  That made my choice even easier.  I love not having to fuss with a transceiver.  Even though the VX Nano uses a micro-USB receiver, it still took up 1 of only 3 USB ports on my laptop.I like the way the mouse feels and looks.  It also comes with a nice padded case with a velcro enclosure.  The scroll wheel is nice and comfortable to use and doesn't feel flimsy like some tend to do.  Battery life is just okay.  It's rated at 3+ months but I have seen real-world results of closer to 2 months.  I use it for probably 2-3 hours/day 7 days a week and I never turn it off.  When I'm connected, I stay connected without any drops.I view the lack of driver or software for required on the 5000 as a welcome feature.  I never install Microsoft's driver software or Logitech's SetPoint software for my mice and keyboards.  Sometimes I lose some functionality, mostly in programmable buttons and keys, but I've had enough driver-related issues on my system to cause me to avoid installing them.I have only a few very minor complaints.  Instead of only offering an on/off button, adding an automatic sleep/off feature would greatly improve battery life.  When you do have to replace the batteries, you'll struggle with removing the batteries a bit because the little pulls that help you remove the batteries are undersized.  I don't have long enough fingernails to easily grab the pulls.  Lastly, whenever my laptop goes to sleep, I have to cross my fingers that the bluetooth connection gets reestablished.  Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.  I have used the 5000 on my laptop with both Windows XP and Windows 7.I thought that after a year, surely a new Microsoft, Logitech, or even Kensington bluetooth mouse would've been released that would take praise away from the 5000.  Nope.  This is still the best notebook bluetooth mouse on the market.  The 3 year warranty isn't as long as I would like, but Microsoft's hardware warranty is easier to deal with than any other company's I've experienced.

It is a well built mouse that pairs easily to my HP laptop running Windows 7 64bit.  The main reason that I bought this mouse is because I have a very small laptop and it only has 2 USB ports.  I had been using a Microsoft wireless mobile mouse 3000 (4 button) and I love the extra button which I program for various duties for each program that is open.  This bluetooth mouse offers the extra button and does not require the USB receiver so I thought it would be perfect.  As it turns out, it is ok, but not perfect.The Good:- The mouse paired with my laptop without any problems at all and has never failed to connect.- I'm still on the original battery with almost 400 hours use, so it seems to have good battery life.- Compact- Handy neoprene caseThe not so good:- The 4th button is too easy to hit on accident.The Bad:- There is no way to program what the 4th button to do different things for each program (see workaround below).- The optical sensor is located at the rear of the mouse, not the middle as with most mice.I can live with the 4th button being easy to hit (I like to program it to ""save"" in all programs except on web browsers an in windows explorer, where I use it as the ""back"" button). But Microsoft Intellipoint software does not work with the bluetooth mouse so you can't program what the button does (it is always a ""back"" button).  By digging around on the web, I found a free program, X-Mouse button control (ver 2.0) that will intercept mouse clicks from any mouse (including this one) and let you re-map them to do whatever you want - it actually is far superior to MS intellipoint.As for the location of the optical sensor, you just have to get used to it.  Because the sensor is so far back, you can't just move the front of the mouse to make minor adjustments to cursor location, you have to use the heel of your hand.  It's about like taping a pen to your wrist and then trying to write.Even with the problems, I'm not going to switch back to the old mouse.4 Stars overall, would have been 5 if the sensor was closer to the front.",4.0,A very capable bluetooth mouse,1303084800,"04 18, 2011"

Bluetooth pairing was painless, and I'm pleased with the smooth functioning of the mouse, not to mention the elimination of the transceiver unit--one more black box I'd have to schlep around.Size and shape are matters of personal preference, and I agree with a previous reviewer who suggested trading off some comfort is an acceptable compromise for portability. Overall, this mouse has a quality feel and seems to be well made; it has a nice heft to it, and the buttons and wheel provide solid, reassuring tactile feedback.My biggest beef with this mouse is the lack of a dedicated or inclusive driver. It does not come with a driver disk, and it is not listed among the supported models in the latest Microsoft IntelliPoint software. Please don't misunderstand: this mouse works fine out of the box under Win XP (and, presumably, Vista).

AN81JUYW2SL24,B000TG4BA0,Gearhead Mania,"[3, 4]","UPDATE 5-9-09: I would give this mouse only 3 out of 5 stars.Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000OS Environments evaluated: XP Home, MCE, and Pro. Vista Home Premium.Bluetooth Radios used: Dell Wireless 350, Dell Wireless 370, Broadcom (all 2.0 + EDR or 2.1 + EDR)I never looked at Bluetooth devices or technology until I learned that a Bluetooth mouse does not need an external transceiver like other RF wireless mice. I read plenty of horror stories about Bluetooth being a failure, etc... I bought two of the Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mice and used them on a variety of Dell laptops. They go to sleep after 10-15 minutes and take 1-2 seconds to wake up. If it takes longer, you need to change your Bluetooth driver stack and application. I had trouble with my Toshiba Bluetooth (Dell Inspiron E1505/6400) stack sucking up CPU cycles in XP (30%-80% constant) and I experimented for awhile only to end up removing it and using the default Microsoft BT enumerator (which uses up no additional memory and works flawlessly). The BT mice stay on and the IR laser does not appear to use up a lot of power. I make it a habit to use NiMH rechargeable cells for my wireless devices to save on battery costs. The range with BT is astounding. At 30 feet or more, the mouse was working smoothly. I lost my line of sight with the laptop so I have not tested the extreme range of the mouse. I have yet to have the mice drop their connections so it appears to stay connected with the BT network.The laser tracking is very precise and smooth. Although the IR laser is not visible to the naked eye, do not stare at it even though its power rating is neither declared nor powerful enough to hurt your eyes. The back button works right out of the box without additional software or drivers. I did not install the Intellipoint software nor did I have to download any drivers. I am a minimalist when it comes to PC peripherals, so I hook it up first and see what happens. If it works out of the box, what point is there to install potential bloatware? I turned the mouse on, held the connect button until the battery LED alternated between green and red, then told my laptop to look for a new BT device. Bingo presto, it works. I have heard some complaints about BT technology but I have used this mouse for over a week and have not run into any issues with BT or the mouse. I have my doubts about wireless mice and keyboards for gaming because any delay or random errors are unacceptable, but for an office computer or laptop, Bluetooth wireless is the only way to get in order to get rid of a funky external transceiver.The left and right mouse buttons are 1 piece and have a soft tactile response. The back button is easy to reach but I always use the ""claw grip"" for my mice. The scroll wheel has a lot of play and is rather noisy. The wheel button has the same feedback as the primary buttons.Pros: Sleek, lightweight, laser tracking, all buttons function out of the box, no software/drivers needed. Interfaced with three different Bluetooth radios/cards installed in Dell laptops. Plug and Play! 30 feet or longer range.Cons: Might be more expensive in the end since you need a Bluetooth card to use this mouse. If you want the cheapest way to get a wireless mouse, the RF wireless style with external USB transceivers are your best bets. Alternatively, if you already have a Bluetooth card for your other Bluetooth devices, the cost is a non-issue since the Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook 5000 is a quality mouse and worth the premium.Overall: Microsoft's reputation for hardware precedes them. I have used many of their mice, keyboards, and joysticks in the past and would not hesitate to buy more Microsoft hardware. This Bluetooth Notebook mouse is no exception and the only thing that has yet to be seen is battery lifespan. I never shut off the mice since I use rechargeable batteries. There is a LED indicator to provide data on battery life but I would recommend changing or charging the batteries at least once a month.UPDATE: Using rechargeable high-capacity NiMh AAA batteries, the mouse will start showing the red ""low battery"" indicator within 2 weeks of usage. I never shut off the mice and I just leave it ""on"". It will go into sleep mode by itself. My old Microsoft optical wireless notebook mouse would use the same NiMh AA battery for over 2 months without a recharge.UPDATE: I bought two of these mice for use with my laptops and I have observed that the rubberized coating on the sides comes apart after awhile. It only happens on the right side. I suspect it is because of either my nails digging in, or the oils on my hand. It does not interfere with the operation of the mouse, but it does look kind of cheap and tacky.UPDATE 5-9-09: Both mice have intermittent connection issues. They drop out and sometimes never get paired again. I tried changing batteries to no avail. The rubberized textured grips are peeling apart like before, but one of the mice is totally dead. It makes a high-pitched sound when it is on, but the status LED is non-functional and I cannot pair it with any of my Bluetooth enabled computers.Overall I would give this mouse 3 out of 5 stars. It works great when it is operational, but it's not very reliable and the build quality is mediocre.",5.0,"Works great when it works, intermittent issues",1227830400,"11 28, 2008"

It is comfortable to use, however.It connected to my computer very easily, and I haven't had to setup the connection again. My computer finds it, and it connects.Now for the negatives. The back button, which I didn't even realize it had, gets pressed very easily. At first I thought it was something I pressed on the keyboard, but then I realized it was the mouse. The button is placed just next to your inner thumb, and even while I was actively trying not to press it, I pressed it. IT WILL PRESS THE BACK BUTTON ON YOUR BROWSER if you have big hands.To fix this, I had to remove the button and physically cut of the plastic attached to it, which activates the mechanism in the mouse. I would not recommend doing this because then the button sinks in because there is nothing to support it.Another problem I had with it is responsiveness. Previously, I had a wireless mouse which used visible light to work. This one uses a real, invisible laser. I thought this was very cool, until I realized it doesn't work too well. My old mouse worked without a mouse pad nearly anywhere, even on my couch. But I need a mouse pad for this one. This is really a personal complaint, because I know most people do use mouse pads everyday.Also, the scroll wheel on the top of the mouse jams up a little when you pull it backwards (to scroll down the page.) It doesn't affect the scrolling, but is a little annoying. This is a minor complaint, but doesn't help this mouse's ratings.I would not recommend this mouse, at least to people with big hands who don't use mouse pads.

If you perhaps were a small child, this might be a good mouse. My hands are not large, I'm just an average sized guy, but you have to hold this mouse way back to be able to get all the buttons, wheel, and the side button. This leaves half of your hand off the mouse, it's very awkward.Worse is, it's one of those mice where the Scroll Wheel clicks as it scrolls (a good thing!), but the actual scrolling doesn't match well to the clicks - sometimes it will scroll twice for a single position, and sometimes not at all. Overall, it's uncomfortable and somewhat jarring to use because of this. The button presses feel a little mushy on the left button, however the right button is crisp.  Microsoft didn't ship intellipoint with the mouse, and if you go to their site, it's not listed either. The mouse works in both Windows and Mac, but Intellipoint doesn't recognize it as a ""microsoft"" mouse, so you can't assign the buttons. I had to use a third party app to do this. Apparently this mouse hasn't been manufactured in a long time, and wasn't well supported when it was.Now the good - The pointer movement feels right (not too fast, not too slow).

You should not even bother installing it if you're using mac os. I can't speak for other systems.2. Frequently disconnects from computer and takes a while to reconnect. It sometimes didn't reconnect at all and I was forced to pair it again with the computer.3. Randomly woke up my computer at night, causing the screen to come back on and wake me up. It got to the point where I either had to turn off the mouse or close the lid on my notebook.4. Battery life isn't amazing. You can expect a set to last 3 weeks or so. If you go with this mouse, I recommend getting rechargeable batteries and always keeping a set charged. This will save you quite a bit of money in the long-run.5. Sometimes skipped or became unresponsive in the middle of an activity.  I would imagine that someone such as a gamer would stay away from a wireless mouse in the first place, but having this issue while playing a game could be very frustrating.Overall: I am never buying another microsoft product again.  They used to be an excellent company for hardware, but now they just seem to indiscriminately market products that should have stayed on the drawing board.

The Logitech suffered from an extremely short range, so I decided to use bluetooth for the extended range.The battery life is pretty decent.  It's not much of an obstacle for me, as I use rechargeable batteries, and I always have a fresh set to swap.  However, I usually get about 3 or 4 weeks on a set of batteries (rechargeable rayovacs), and I never even bother to turn it off.  The batteries are kinda tough to change.

I haven't picked up on using it to ""go back"" (which it does well).  It bothers me because I always seem to hit it on accident and go back from something that I didn't mean to.  I don't bump it much anymore though.Pros*Great battery life*Long range*Tracks on strange surfaces well*Low cost on Amazon*Never lags*Wakes very quicklyCons*Battery light doesn't work*Back button is a little awkward*Batteries are difficult to change without some kind of toolAll in all, it's a great mouse, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of my bad battery light.I just purchased another of these to use with my other HTPC in the living room.Update:This mouse may be better suited for faster PCs.  It has always worked great on my Gateway (Intel Core 2 Quad, 8Gb RAM, SSD, etc.).  I tried it on an out of the box Acer (AMD dual core 1.6 GHz, 4Gb RAM, much slower than my Gateway), and it lagged A LOT... in fact, it was almost unusable.  I then tried it on a Dell I have (Intel Core i5 3.0 GHz quad core, 8Gb RAM, SSD, etc.) and it works great.  Maybe there's something I'm missing here, but this mouse seems like it works much better on faster PCs.So... you may want to consider another kind of mouse if your PC isn't top notch.

AJ2ICMO59T3H,B000TG4BA0,J. M. Taylor,"[2, 3]","If you are like me and own a netbook, you bought one for the portability. I'm a college student and do a lot of studying at coffee shops. For some reason, the designers of these places feel that the tables can be no larger than 18 inches in diameter (or so it seems!). Once the text books are out, there is usually little space for the computer let alone accessories.I was using aLogitech V220 Cordless Optical Mouse for Notebooks (Scarlet Red)with mySamsung NC10-14GB 10.2-Inch Blue Netbook - Up to 8 Hours of Battery Life. It's a great mouse with phenomenal battery life, accurate tracking, and a comfy grip. But I've always hated the inch-plus USB dongle sticking out of it. I've had a few close calls of almost breaking it off or knocking the whole computer off a table. There are newer mice out there with the Nano receiver, which is also great. Unfortunately the carry case I use is too snug to allow me to stow the netbook with even that tiny little receiver in it.So I arrived at the Bluetooth option.My netbook is running Windows 7 Home Premium, and associating this mouse was a cake walk. I was up and running within a couple minutes! The instructions included are brief but clear, but Microsoft's website has a more in depth trouble shooting section if the need arises.I have not had the 5000 mouse as long as the V220, but I have never dropped a connection, and the laser tracking is quite accurate on anything from hardwood coffee tables to sofa cushions to the fabric arm rests on a Lazy Boy. The mouse is not heavy and if anything it feels almost too light, but this is a plus for the computer user on the go. I cannot comment on battery life, but I expect a bit less from a Bluetooth mouse vs. wireless.Ergonomics - I find the mouse to be extremely comfy, but if I were picking at nits, I'd like to see the scroll wheel stick up a bit more. The back button placement, for me, is awesome. I hate the back buttons where you have to drastically change grip to hit itMicrosoft Arc Mouse (Black)but that's me. This mouse just requires a shift in the thumb and 'boom!'Drivers - I was at first dubious when Microsoft's IntelliPoint software (that allows you to remap buttons, perform special tricks, etc.) did not support this mouse. In fact, Windows 7 automatically found the needed drivers, installed them, and allowed me to go on with life. For me, button remapping is not necessary, and out of the box most right handed users will be well served by this mouse. But south-paws may not like it.Final thoughts - as a student I study in various locations so portability is a must. The Bluetooth mouse allows me to free up a USB port, and I have found the signal reception to be flawless. When the computer is put to sleep )lid closed) it does take a couple seconds to work again upon awakening, but no complaints here. The accuracy is spot on for 99% of the tasks required of it (maybe a person working with minute details won't be happy, but for Office tasks, web surfing, etc., it works a charm).I really recommend this product to mobile users, and if the ItelliPoint is updated in the future to support customizing this mouse, then more's the better. But as is, I feel its a winner.Cheers!***Edited 3-15-2012***I dropped this mouse down a couple of stars after using it for some time. I love that it is Bluetooth and thus frees up a USB port. And up until recently, it was great. But all of a sudden, it would stop responding. I would have to attempt to pair the mouse with my computer again (sometimes the computer wouldn't 'see' the mouse even when I had the mouse ready for connection and sitting right beside the laptop). It became a more and more frequent issue, that I no longer use the mouse.Another issue that manifested after awhile was that the middle scroll button/wheel would be easily and accidentally depressed. The scroll wheel sits very low in between the left and right buttons, that it would sometimes get clicked on accident.The scroll wheel thing was a minor annoyance, but the repeated drop in pairing with the computer was a hassle.Hope this helps.",3.0,Great option for netbooks and Windows 7,1263772800,"01 18, 2010"

The wireless version requires you to remove the dongle from the laptop and secure it in a slot on the bottom of the mouse in order to shut it down.

But, both are from Microsoft. Previously, I had another bluetooth mouse working perfectly with Win XP. This mouse worked with my laptop with Win XP but had many problems with the other one with Win 7 (64bit). I had to turn the mouse on and off every time I logged on the laptop. There were a lot of discussions on internet reporting the same issue. And, suddenly, while the mouse was still working, it became invisible from the device manager.But, finally, I gave up trying because I can not get the mouse to be activated during the log-on period when launching Window. With Microsoft wireless 6000 mouse, I had no problem. It seems to me the bluetooth radio is turned on only after logging in while the wireless radio is turned before logging in.I have tried many tips from internet and no avail. My wife is not going to tolerate this new mouse with less responsiveness.So, I returned the second one and order another Microsoft 6000 wireless mouse and was pleasantly surprised by the prices drop recently.So, what is the point of having a bluetooth mouse if it is more expensive than the wireless mouse and less responsive?",2.0,Difficult to pair with Win 7 64 bit,1306195200,"05 24, 2011"

But ever since I upgraded to Windows 7, this mouse spontaneously unpairs itself every day. Usually it's fine if I uninstall it and then reinstall it, but lately it's stopped even doing that.

A1FTNS27PU2LT0,B000TG4BA0,Michael Lovett,"[0, 0]","I was excited to get this mouse as it was my first Bluetooth device for my new laptop. This mouse replaced a previous Microsoft mouse, a wireless optical USB mouse.I use a mouse extensively as part of my job and I'm pretty sensitive to its ergonomics. Here's what I've found so far:1. Battery position is too far rearward. When I lift up the mouse in my normal mousing position, in order to move it, the weight of the batteries being toward the back throws the balance of the mouse off and the back end of the mouse does not easily lift up while the front-end points skyward. In order to actually move it, I have to let go of the mouse, move my fingers back a bit to find the balance point and then lift it. This is a total pain. I have found this with other wireless mice as well, but my most recent Microsoft mouse did not have this problem2. Another problem when lifting the mouse to reposition it: the laser is *too sensitive* unless you lift the mouse much higher off the work surface than with any other mouse I've used, and I've probably used hundreds over the years. The problem is, when you lift the mouse what I consider a normal amount, in order to move it, the pointer doesn't stay fixed where it was; the laser reports you are still moving the mouse on the mousing surface and thus the pointer follows your movement. Thus, to physically lift the mouse and move it over a couple of inches (i.e,. what you have to do when trying to mouse across a large resolution area) you actually have to lift and move many times, not just once.. OR you have to lift the mouse an inch or more in the air. Both options are a pain.I would really like to know who does Microsoft's ergonomics testing..Anyone who actually uses a computer???",2.0,"Nice idea, but design problems",1249862400,"08 10, 2009"
A1741583PWMYLQ,B000TG4BA0,"Michael Perez ""Mgamerz Productions""","[0, 0]","I bought this mouse for my Asus N53JQ - XV1 laptop. It has Bluetooth 2.1+EDR built into it, on Windows 7 Professional x64.This mouse works right out of the gate with Windows 7. You just go to Start>Devices and Printers>Add a Device, and on the mouse, you turn it on and press the (B) icon (Bluetooth icon on the bottom). When it shows up in the 'add a device window', you click it, press next, and wait for about a minute while drivers are fetched, and you are good to go.Just leave Bluetooth on, and next time you switch it on, it'll automatically connect. That's all there is to setting up this mouse.Battery life is okay, it's not as good as Microsoft says (3 months if I recall correctly), but I won some free rechargeable batteries, so it's not that much of a problem to juice them up. I don't use the mouse too often because most times I have classes at my school. It's sometimes easy to forget that it is on, and I don't think it auto-turns off if it's not connected to anything. Mainly because it uses a switch and not a power button. It featurs one LED on the top below the wheel to indicate power(green glow on startup), low power(flashing red), and pairing mode(alternating red/green blinking).The range is pretty nice. Better than my Motorola S9-HD Bluetooth headphones, but that isn't saying much either. I get about the size of an average family room of a house before it becomes hit or miss. That might not sound like much, but unless you are using a JumboTron you probably won't need that kind of range.The construction quality is great. This thing is a engineering masterpiece. It feels great in your hand and zips around on just about anything. It doesn't work on glass (almost no mice do except old school mice), but it works on every surface I use it on. It comes with a little pouch that fits perfectly with it. I love when products come with pouches. One thing about it though, that I miss from my desktop mouse is a forward button. It's easy to hit the back button on the left, but without a forward button you can't go forward again easily. My Logitech MX310 wired mouse has both, and I can't live with mice that don't have those buttons. Granted, forward is not as useful as back, but it's still useful.One thing I DON'T like is that it never asks you for a pin. I'm not sure if it's a 'pinless' connection (if it is, then it's my problem, not the devices), but I have some trouble getting it to work on Linux and my Motorola Atrix 4G(Doesn't support pinless bluetooth yet).Overall, if you don't want one of those dongles from Logitech and the like, then this is for you.

It's not a big issue for me.  I usually know when the batteries are out when the mouse stops responding (all of my other cordless mice didn't even have a battery indicator).I don't think this mouse is intended for gaming purposes, although I haven't tried.

A3W411P9H6QKEW,B000TG4BA0,Nick Hsieh,"[1, 1]","I wanted a wireless Bluetooth mouse to use with my laptop so as to not take up a USB port with a cord or RF adapter. I also needed it to not cost a fortune and to be Mac compatible. This one fit the bill. I like that it has an on/off switch to conserve power and make it more convenient to transport. Most of the time I leave it on my desk and don't actually turn the mouse off, but it's nice to be able to turn it off when I'm going to take it with me. The mouse feels high quality and is comfortable to use. It's not too light, but I actually might have preferred a little more heft. The buttons press without too much pressure but also without feeling flimsy, and the sides are coated in a soft rubber material. There are four buttons--left, right, scroll wheel click, and back. Although Microsoft IntelliPoint isn't obtrusive, I found it unnecessary and uninstalled it. The mouse buttons are all programmable via Expos&eacute;; on the Mac.A few minor drawbacks: The scroll wheel is a bit stiff and notched, and more so in the upward direction than the down. Be aware that this mouse is small. It is definitely meant to be a travel mouse. I would have liked it to be a little bit larger, but the mouse is high enough to actually promote a reasonably good posture. Still, a good wrist-support to use with this mouse is probably a good idea. Of course, the compact dimensions make it more portable.I had looked at theLogitech V470 Bluetooth Cordless Laser Mouseand I might have liked it's slightly larger size and weight, and I do like the fact that it uses AA instead of AAA batteries, but it was substantially more expensive. I ended up going with the Business model of this mouse because it was cheaper and because I prefer the darker color scheme. Unfortunately, I discovered that the Business model does not come with a carry bag. Not a big loss, but worth knowing.I can't speak to battery life yet, as I've only had the mouse for a short time. It comes with regular Duracell AAA batteries. Come time to replace the batteries, I'm thinking I'll get theAmazonBasics AAA NiMH Precharged Rechargeable Batteries (4-Pack, 800 mAh)for it. I'll update if I discover anything worth saying about the battery life.[Update 7/18/12]I still really appreciate many of the positives about this mouse mentioned in my original review, however, regular use has revealed that it is too small both in length and width to provide comfortable long-term use. After using it for work for some time, I found that my fingers, wrist, and forearm were hurting. This is because the mouse is so small (narrow) that my hand ends up bunched up trying to grip it, and it's short enough that my wrist is unsupported. I have medium sized hands and fingers. My wife has smaller hands and has been using a corded Logitech Notebook Mouse, which is much smaller. I'm going to see if she is comfortable with this mouse, otherwise I'll have to return it. For what it's worth, I've rarely turned the mouse off and used it as a primary work device, and so far the batteries are still good.",4.0,Great Little Mouse,1340755200,"06 27, 2012"

A141OPVE376YFI,B000TG4BA0,Paul Gifford,"[13, 13]","I bought this mouse in February 2009.  It lasted about 18 months.  During that time I used it daily, traveled halfway around the world to a desert with it, and carried it on numerous trips in the United States.  It finally died because I dropped it one too many times...and I dropped it a lot.  Wanting to try a different mouse I replaced it with aLogitech V470 Bluetooth Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks.  You can read my review of that mouse on its product page, but in short, this mouse is far superior.This mouse is sturdy (lasting through travel and abuse by me) and while the battery door and batteries would come off when I dropped it, the mouse always went back together well.  It's about as comfortable as a little mouse can be, which is not very, but it's certainly usable.  The mouse connected fast enough when I started the computer and battery life was reasonable.  I didn't keep a log of when I replaced the batteries in it but I went months between battery changes...3 or more I'd say.Where this mouse really shines (and easily surpasses the Logitech V470) is in sensitivity and ability to operate on a variety of surfaces.  I never had any trouble with tracking on any surface, including furniture, the carpet, my pants leg, and our granite countertop.  I often use my laptop in the kitchen when cooking and it was nice to use the mouse on the countertop.  With the Logictech mouse I had to put my lapdesk on the counter and use that as the mouse surface.  The Logitech was horrible on fabric surfaces (furniture, my pants) as well.I wish this mouse was bigger...I'd love a full-size Bluetooth mouse.  The back button is nice but two buttons would be nicer (for forward and back).  The Logitech V470 has no buttons but you can move the scroll wheel to the left and right and I mapped that action to backwards and forwards in my browser.This isn't the best mouse around (I'm partial to my 3-year old discontinuedLogitech G5 Laser Mouse) but it's the best Bluetooth mouse in my opinion.  That's why I'm back here today...to buy one of these for my wife to use with her new laptop.

I have used many mice (Microsofts & Logitechs) and I would rate this one as one of the better mice for notebooks.  A great feature is the bluetooth.  For some reason it is difficult to find a bluetooth mice on the market.  Even though the dongles for most mice have shrunken to micro proportions, I would prefer not to have one at all.  Especially for a notebook that gets used frequently with a bag.  I wouldn't want the dongle to be in a position where it can damage the laptop because it's sticking out (although a very small possibility, still exists nonetheless).That being said if you use this for too long it puts a strain on your pinky finger, at least it does for me.  After several hours of use it starts to get a bit uncomfortable and I find myself rubbing my hands or trying to shift my hands over to find a better position to use the mouse.I have Windows 7 and it set up within a minute.  There have been no problems connecting to the mouse since I purchased it.I would buy this mouse if you like a stylish mouse that connects over bluetooth with some functionality (it does have a back button on the side).I wouldn't buy this mouse if you are going to be using it for long periods of time, or for desktop use.*update 9/22/10I have been using this for awhile and I have to say that the battery life is much shorter than a Logitech mouse.

I will add that I rarely turn it off and I do use the mouse heavily.  Also the back button on the mouse is broken.  It still works but there is no spring to it anymore and there is no clicking.

I changed my review back to a 4 star based on my original review.  The mouse had a problem but was easily fixed by the company.  They were prompt in emailing and in resolution.  I will be receiving my replacement mouse soon and hopefully I shouldn't have another problem.  :)*update 10/11/10I have received the new mouse within two weeks of my emailing.  Microsoft was great about the warranty, it was simple and quick.Concerning the mouse, after extensive use I am going to update several things:1) The battery does not last as long as mice that use dongles.  This mouse uses two AAA batteries and from frequent use (5+ hours a day) and having it always on it appears to drain in approximately 2.5 weeks.  This isn't a big problem for myself because I use rechargeable batteries but it may detract others.2) I initially reported that it was a bit uncomfortable because it was a small mouse to use.  I bought this beanbag thing that elevates your wrist when you use a mouse and this has fixed the problem.

And that's saying something: I've owned literally dozens and dozens of mice over the years. I've owned large mice, small mice, high-precision mice, trackballs, thumballs, wireless mice, corded mice, and on and on. Some had scroll wheels, some had ""control sticks"" (much like the ""eraser head"" design we sometimes see on certain brands of laptops). Some were quite heavy. Some were so lightweight that they seemed empty of any interior mechanics. Most worked acceptably well, but none were really anything you would write home about.The Microsoft Bluetooth 5000 Mouse, however, has turned out to be a bit different to me. I purchased the device to accompany my Bluetooth equipped laptop, an HP dv2000. From the moment I started using the mouse, I liked it, and liked it a lot. After using it a year, I still like it a lot, because it works well, is comfortable, and is small enough to transport easily with my laptop. I would recommend this mouse as a great mouse for most anyone, and although there are always new designs appearing, I still find this particular mouse quite impressive.

It is incredibly fast and responsive, as fast as any mouse I've owned.  I'm one of those people who just can't come to terms with using a touchpad, so this has definitely improved my love life with my laptop.Nonetheless, if I can find a different mouse that fits my hand better I probably will.  I like a large mouse and this one is just very, very tiny.  Part of the problem is the way I've always used a mouse, pushing the button with the tip of my finger, whereas the way to use this mouse is to use your entire finger.  Still, even learning to use it more efficiently this mouse just doesn't quite work with my hand.But the major problem I have with the mouse -- though I have hopes of disabling this feature -- is the third button that is located on the left side of the mouse.  When you have a web browser opened, it takes you back to the previous screen.  So, If I'm typing on a board or chatboard or filling out a form and accidently hit the back button on the mouse, I lose everything I wrote.  I'm not certain that I will ever come to like this.  And because the mouse is so small, it is incredibly easy to hit the button by accident.  For instance, just reaching for it, the third button is one of the easiest spots to hit.  Browser open?  Then BACK!But if this isn't a problem for you or if your hand fits the mouse better, this could well be a perfect mouse.

A3NG4HM0P9OIED,B000TG4BA0,Rodrigo Lopez Schenkel,"[217, 231]","I have been using this mouse for almost a month now and I am very satisfied with it. It is smaller than most mice, but fits snuggly in my hand, considering that I have big hands. It is very responsive (sometimes too responsive) and the back button and mouse wheel complement its functionality. The battery indicator is another great plus, cause at least you can get a warning when you are running low; although it is very energy-efficient, I'm still using the packed standard AAA batteries with an average of 6-7 hours of daily use. And the power switch is also great for saving energy.To sum up, Pros:- Excellent Microsoft design (esthetical, ergonomical)- Great price- Very responsive (it's laser, not optical)- Great battery life (I'll let you know on the comments when the first pair of batteries run out. I already have a rechargeable pair on stand-by).- Instant pairing with bluetooth enabled PC's (I did not try it on a Mac)- Back button functionality- Power switch lets you turn it off when not in use to save battery, and you just turn it on and in a couple of seconds it reconnects (this has been a life-saver since I walk away from my desk very often, and I would not like that some envious co-worker ""borrowed"" it for his home, and it fits quite nicely on my shirt or pants pocket)- It glides very smoothly on almost any surface (even on my bed sheets)- It comes with a nice carry-bag.Cons:- It has dropped the connection about 5 or 6 times during the time I have been using it, but it reconnects after turning on and off again. Kind of annoying.- I wish it had a forward buttong as well.- It is somethimes too responsive, depending on the surface you wear it on. I fixed this by tweaking the mouse sensitivity on the Windows mouse settings.I recommend this bluetooth mouse.UPDATE (2/23/08): Well, the battery indicator is going red now (3 months after I started using it), but, if I could, I would downgrade my rating to 3 stars because of the following: The power switch broke like a week ago (the damn thing kinda got loose of it's place and still moves, but it doesn't change the power state). I tried going DIY and tried fixing it myself, but ended up getting it worse, although I managed the leave the power on. This means poor craftsmanship from Microsoft, because I consider I did not misused the mouse. I now can't turn the mouse off, so I have to remove the batteries every time I don't use it. This resulted on casting the mouse aside and leaving it just for special occasions (long meetings or surfing @ home).I still consider the mouse is good, but this has negatively changed my opinion on Microsoft hardware (don't even get me started on their SW).",4.0,Very good bluetooth mouse,1197417600,"12 12, 2007"

If you want a bluetooth mouse, this one is worthy of consideration.This mouse uses AAA batteries, which I dislike.  AA batteries have a much longer life, and add desirable weight and heft to the mouse.  My Kensington Bluetooth Mouse uses AA batteries and this gives it a much nicer, more solid feel.  And longer battery life.The scroll wheel on this mouse is not particularly good. It has a rough feel and if you press too hard you get that auto-scroll function when you don't really want it.  My Kensington mouse, by comparison, was much less prone to accidental activation of that (not very desirable) auto-scroll feature.On the plus side, this mouse has a nice shape to it.  It is smaller than most notebook mice, which is a plus.

A2LGGKMLUDG9QN,B000TG4BA0,Tim,"[0, 0]","I've been trying to find a BT mouse for a long time that was portable and comfortable so I don't have to use the stupid radio antennas.  I've had several, but they invariably were too small.Pros: The 5000 is almost too small, but actually is pretty comfortable in the hand.  Setup was a little goofy, since I'm use to seeing light on the bottom of the mouse to indicate that it's tracking.  My laptop (Vaio) found and installed it quickly; however, I had to set up in both BT devices and regular devices, since the Vaio only setup in regular devices and it wouldn't work until I setup in BT devices. For some reason the 5000 laser isn't lighting up like other mice, but it still works.  The mouse tracks precisely and well, has 4 buttons, hand sits ergonomically comfortable on it, and so far the laser tracks on all the surfaces I've asked it to do (desk, pad, bed sheet, recliner arm, etc).  I have not seen any lost signal when my laptop goes to sleep, although there is a less than second delay when the mouse power saves, but it is not annoying.  The left and right buttons engage nicely with good tactile feel and click.Cons: The power button on the bottom of the mouse just feels cheap, and initially sliding it on didn't engage all the way.  I tend to have my hand rest forward more on the mouse, so I would prefer the back button on the side to be forward a little; however, this is personal preference since if your hand placement is actually how it should be on the mouse, the button and thumb position is right on.  The biggest annoyance is the track wheel, which is a clicker.  I don't think the clicking accurately scrolls, and would prefer a smooth scrolling wheel.  The scroll wheel as a push button is too easy to push down so the scroll lock engages too easily, which is annoying when I'm only trying to scroll up and down.",4.0,Nice,1348876800,"09 29, 2012"
