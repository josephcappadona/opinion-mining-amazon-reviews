"[509, 519]",1258761600,AQF43LVMM6IMK,"I have had many polarizers over the years. I have used filters such as this for over 25 years. I like the Tiffen as it is not too dark for most uses. I keep it on for almost every shot (unless it is night time or quite dark) to protect my lenses and for it's mild polarizing effect. (I take 1000s of images on a shoot, mostly landscape) Some other brands are too dark to do this. The dark ones many times look too polarized, and post processing has to take much of this out anyway. I do have a few of these and use them occasionally. I have found that an image that is properly balanced that does not need too much darkening or lightening post processing is much better,  I have a Hoya but it is always falling apart (and way too dark). I have Heliopan 77mm Circular Polarizer Lens Filters and like the quality, but again they are too dark to keep on all the time. The Heliopan is the one I keep for special uses when I want more polarizing effects than I get with the Tiffen. The Tiffen polarizers I have had only were replaced when they became too scratched for use, broken from being dropped or run into things, or lost over board in my boat. As I said a couple of Hoya ones were replaced because they fell apart.I use a Canon 5D with all high end L series lenses (most costing well over $1000.00) and have sold over 1300 framed GiClees ($300-$800 each). I feel that this filter does not compromise the quality of my images.So in review. I don't want an unnatural appearance due to my filters. I do want the pleasing effects I can achieve with the Tiffen filter. I have never had a problem with any I had purchased, so recommend them to others.

"[3, 7]",1374105600,AKJD16NO3HE2S,"Just to let you know - I am not a professional and am just beginning to take my first, baby steps with filters. I read about polarizing filters and I became interested in trying one out. Not being sure about the results I'd get and most definitely not being able to afford an expensive one, I picked the Tiffen 58mm to experiment with. I purchased this filter for use with my Canon Vixia HF G10 video camera in the hopes that I could get some satisfactory sky / beach shots. (in this humid, hazy summer time weather, my outdoor shots are just meh)This is my first polarizing filter and my first day with it and so far, I am having nothing but problems with it.First, I suspect that I have received a used filter because the package was not sealed and the filter was dirty on both sides. (shipped and sold by Amazon.com)I cleaned it off and attached it to my UV filter that was already in place on my camera. This brings us to the second issue. It kept falling off. Luckily I was seated at the time and it fell into my lap rather than onto the concrete sidewalk. So then I got the bright idea (not!) of attaching it directly to my camera. This solved the problem of it staying in place (boy, did it ever!) and I thought that I could actually begin testing it out however, I could not adjust the outer ring with the camera hood in place. (In broad daylight, I *must* have the hood on my camera otherwise I get lens flares.)Trying to adjust it and then putting the hood on causes the filter ring to move.Lastly, I absolutely can not get it off of my camera. Yes, I am aware of which part of the filter that needs to be grasped and turned. Yes, I tried the rubber band and bottle opener grip and latex glove methods all without success. I have to go purchase the filter wrenches now and hope that works otherwise, I'll have to take my camera to a pro and see if they can get it off (I wonder how much they charge for that?)I wanted to do some ""with and without"" shots for comparison but was not able to do so.This filter seems to be more trouble than it's worth. I don't see myself ever attaching it directly to my camera again (that is, if I ever get it off!)Edit: I had to wait a few days for my order of filter wrenches to arrive (I couldn't find any shops locally that had them). Once they arrived and after a few attempts, I was finally able to remove the filter from my camera.","07 18, 2013",1.0,B00004ZC8Y,Nothing but problems so far :(,An Amazon Customer

"[0, 0]",1397260800,A3H4S6YO9VNGDZ,"First I'll just say this is pretty good glass. But why would we want it?Most of us started wearing polarized sunglasses years ago and I for one just thought they work and that's enough to know. The more I got into photography the more gadgets I acquired and polarized filters seemed a good idea.So I studied on the science behind it and won't bore you with it but it's about reducing reflected light and an easy way to see a dramatic change is being in a boat on the water. The next is to be on clear water and see the bottom 20 feet down.So I have this filter and another lighter polarized filter and one or the other is usually being used in bright sunlight. The reason is that reflected light tends to wash out the picture. If you're thinking that you can just use contrast for that, to some degree you're correct, but it's not the same. To get close to the same will take a combination of  very careful program adjustments rather than screwing on your filter which is doing it before the picture instead of after.This filter is wonderful in the brightest sunlight and does its job admirably, it's very good quality and I've only had one issue. With one of my lenses it messes with AF if it's not bright enough out, in which case I switch to a Polaroid filter with less effect if I choose not to go manual focus.In the end you'll save time in your program while getting better pictures and learning how you prefer to use it won't take a real long time. Polarized is my most used filter and if I need a replacement I'll by another of these. I hope I've been of assistance.","04 12, 2014",5.0,B00004ZC8Y,To Polarize...Or Not To Polarize....,Anthony J.

I didn't think it was a problem as long as the filter was ok.  Unfortunately, upon opening the unsealed case, I noticed that the lens was very dusty on both sides and there was a big fat thumb print right in the middle of the lens.I tried cleaning the filter with a lens cleaning cloth and it helped to remove the dust but I could not remove the thumb print completely.  I can't see the print anymore with the naked eye but when I blow on it, the steam makes it reappear until it evaporates.  I decided that it was probably not going to affect the pictures much since I couldn't see the print when it was dry.The performance of the lens is decent.  I can see the picture change on my viewfinder as I rotate the filter.  I do find that the rotating part is loose.  If the camera shakes or moves too much, the lens can rotate slightly on its own.  I wish there was a little more resistance to it but most people will try their best to take shots with a steady hand so it shouldn't be a problem.

"[11, 19]",1327449600,A2EW8AJFEHQSO6,"A circular polarizer has three mechanical components. One is the set of threads for mounting to the camera. The second is the mechanism that mounts the rotating polarizing glass to the camera base mount to the camera. The third is the set of threads that allows an additional filter or a lens cap.  Only the last is functional.  The first two are loose. The problem with loose mounting between the filter and the camera can intermittently (one time it works, the next time it doesn't) cause the filter to require a plumber's wrench (hyperbole) to remove the filter; other times it comes off as one would expect. With the rotating glass, it is too loose. Set it and bump the outer ring and the setting is off. Don't think that it can't happen between shots. Other manufacturers' circular filters, have more resistance. Both the filter section and the lens-mount section jiggle in their settings. I only use the outer filter threads for the lens cap. I haven't had any problems losing a lens cap because of the threads. I have had no flare problem with the optics. The unit reviewed is used with a Nikkor lens, 18-200mm.

It can also help to darken the sky in pictures, while not affecting other parts of the picture too much. It does not darken the entire scene, just aspects of it by blocking reflected light.

"[0, 0]",1373328000,A2VI45SXKJHPZU,Great value here folks. I used the polarizer stacked with a Tiffen UV filter/on my canon 200L prime. ZERO light fall off on the edges/no vignetting. I used during a 4th of July family gathering on a bright sunny day. Up to 50% cropping and could not see problems with sharpness/detail/contrast. The circular polarizer blocks 2 stops of light which helped maintain the aperture at a constant f/2.8 @ 200 ISO -2/3 ev shooting raw. Later in the evening I took the polarizer off and took photos with the UV protection filter. Kind of a cheap insurance policy to keep my lens abrasion free and a quick solution when i need more light to work with.

By reducing reflections and stray light waves, this filter makes any scene that much clearer.You will see more vibrant colors in bright scenes, your skies will turn a deeper blue, and clouds POP right off the picture. Reduce glare from reflective surfaces such as metal or water.A polarizer works on a specified plain, meaning that the lens must be perpendicular to the direction of the main light source. As with sunglasses, they are parrallel to the ground, which works in most cases since the sun is normally above you.The key to using this filter is that it swivels. Looking through the view finder, turn the filter until the picture is clear and vibrant. You'll notice the image changing as you turn it. In this manner, you may even adjust the level of polarization.A great deal for a very valuable accessory. This filter works perfect, and compared to the higher priced filters, is a steal.----------------------------------------------UV FILTER:The UV Filter prevents haze and reduces bluish tint in photographs by reducing stray UV rays entering the lens. It also has the added benefit of protecting the lens and glass from scratches and accidental damage.There have been stories of photographers dropping their lens and the filter acts as a sort of impact absorber, shattering but leaving the lens unharmed. I would much prefer replacing the inexpensive filter, rather than a lens.In my experience with the Tiffen UV Filter, I have noticed an increased amount of lens flare and reflections over my slightly more expensive UV filters. If I were you, I'd put out the small amount of extra money for a better filter, preferably multi-coated to reduce glare.Enjoy!","11 25, 2008",4.0,B00004ZC8Y,Circular Polarizer and UV Filter,"Nick Chill ""Nick Chill"""

Like any filter you'll find the lens cap won't be a solid fit as the thread on the opposite end isn't as tall.  But the cap will stay there but just be sure to watch for any bumps that may cause it to come off.The range which it cuts the glare on glass, windows, water and any reflective surface is great.  The sky can look washed out all the way to saturated darker blue color with clouds popping out while depending on the orientation you can add a cool or warmer feel to the photos.I've used Heliopan and B+W so compared to the pro-grade filter, you'll probably find that this polarizer isn't the best out there but for the price it does what it's supposed to.  When I had B+W 77mm multi-coated CPL ($150 here) on my Canon 70-200mm lens, the sky really popped with dark saturated blue skies and the control was better.Overall it's a great polarizer.  Unless you absolutely need more saturated colors and reduce glare to the maxium then go with the more expensive multi-coated filters.  I would say this Tiffen filter is a standard for circular polarizer and won't disappoint.  Plus it protects your lens like any UV or other filters used.  I'd rather smash a $20 filter versus a $400 lens.Circular polarizer does make daytime shots more fun and less correction post processing.  And sometimes you can't control everything you shoot with so a filter becomes a must in some cases.  With a lens that can be as wide as f1.2-f1.8 sometimes putting the ISO level 100 doesn't always allow you to shoot at the widest aperture.  In a sense it does act like a neutral density filter to a degree while cutting glare and allowing you to shoot a fast moving subject or freeze the moment.","05 18, 2013",4.0,B00004ZC8Y,"Great for the price, does it's job",Sidehop

It did!.Another person on YouTube suggested the same thing, but instead looking at a computer monitor.  Again, clear one way, dark the other.Finally I took it outside and tried it on automobile reflections.  Without the filter there was a wide splotch of glare on the hood of the car and with the filter, the splotch was reduced to a tight circle about the size of the sun, so it does work.  After all, it was a direct reflection of the sun.As for bluer sky's, I tried that and it made them bluer (I think?).  It also made pronounced differences on the grass color which was easier to see.  Anyway, I understand that how much difference this makes is determined by the angle of the light so I have some more testing to do.Anyway, at first, I was ready to send this back because I didn't know what to expect or how to test it.  This is one case when ignorance is not bliss.I have to assume that a better filter will be better, but for the price difference, this seems to be a good filter with which to get your feet wet and perhaps will be all that many of us need.On the issue of whether the filter degrades the image...I have only taken a few pictures, but I cannot see any degradation what-so-ever.

If I were a professional photographer, I probably would opt for one of the multi coated options, but as it is, I found it very good for the price and more than adequate for my needs.","09 20, 2011",4.0,B00004ZC8Y,Excellent Circular Polarizer,V.

"[1, 1]",1401667200,A3VGTUB2MNYROV,You can check the polarization extinction by holding the outside (non-threaded) side to your LCD monitor and rotating it. It is almost entirely dark at 45 deg angle when I try this. I have a polarized laser pointer that I used to determine the polarization angle of this filter. It makes my LCD monitor dark when the polarization of the filter is oriented along 1:30 - 7:30 (12:00 being upright -- this means my LCD monitor is polarized along the 10:30 - 4:30 line). Don't know if all LCD monitors have the same polarization.Quality looks good. It is easy to rotate after I have it screwed on to my camera lens. I scratched a line along the edge to mark the polarization. I gave it 4 stars because I bought another CPL (Goja) that is just as good for &#60; 1/2 the price.,"06 2, 2014",4.0,B00004ZC8Y,Good CPL,Wayne S. Pelouch

It has more glare and light loss when compared with a coated filter, but it works just fine for most applications.","09 4, 2013",4.0,B00004ZC8Y,Absolutely NOT a coated filter,W. B. Halper

Unfortunately I have discovered that putting it on the lens was the least of my isues.  Getting it off is a whole new challenge in its own right.  Might as well order the filter removal tool when you buy this filter.  I will say functionally it did a nice job on my photos, but getting this filter off my lens has jaded me on this product.","06 10, 2014",2.0,B00004ZC8Y,"Hope you like it on, because it is not coming off",Wildtrk
