That keyboard's been through hell and is really showing its age in the form of lots of friction and loud keys.I bought the newer MS Natural 4000 a year or two ago at the local retailer for $40.  Compared to my old keyboard it was immediately apparent that they had really engineered the thing down to the thinnest, lightest materials possible.  The keys are reasonably quiet.  I felt like it needed more tilt and angle to the keys, but otherwise was a reasonable keyboard.  I do wish they had kept the editing keys and dispensed with the num pad altogether so that the keyboard wouldn't take up so much desk space.Then the enter key stopped working.  I took it apart and could find nothing wrong, even looking at the traces on the flex circuit under a low-power microscope.  I simply could not find the break, but there definitely was one in the flex circuit because all the other keys worked.For its price, it was okay, while it lasted.

It has a direct button for calculator which I use very often. It has 5 programmable buttons and a favorites buttons. At my work I have these programmed for various scripts and at home, I use them for resmon.exe etc for performance analysis. These are very useful features for programmers and gamers. I have also gamed a lot on this keyboard. I am left handed and use arrow keys instead of WASD, So I didnt notice any limitations. The old versions of these keyboards had a very bad spacebar.

(not too much but i kinda don't like it)Despite the fact that it comes with multimedia keys, it lacks the buttons for previous and next track, so it's a little annoying, there is a work around to assign them to one of the 5 ""favorites keys"", but you have to do a little Windows registry hack.Sometimes the extra keys lag a little while when you first pressed them, it disappears right after you press another key or the same one, I think it's a known issue of the Microsoft Intellitype software, I hope they fix it someday.Bottom line.Great keyboard, great ergonomics, but the space bar sound its too loud for me.

Need to say that they are gradually degraiting (both how they are built and ergonomics).I bought this one, used it for a while and swapped back for the Natural Keyboard Pro (not available anymore on Amazon, but you can see the image here: www.amazon.com/Microsoft-B61-00002-Natural-Keyboard-Pro/dp/B00002JXFH.  Not ideal as well (flimsy and squeeky keys), but way better.I would also recommend the Microsoft Natural Keyboard EliteMicrosoft Natural Keyboard EliteorMicrosoft Wired Natural Keyboard Elite Win PS2/USB English North America Black.  In fact I think I like the ergonomics of it more and use in some cases at work.What is good: Functionality.  Looks good.What I didn't like: Too flat.  The curve could be more pronounced. Keys are flimsy and some don't register when hit; diffeent strength is neet to strike them and when you strike at an angle, like Q, A, Z, it skips them basically making proofreading with a lot of corrections a must and this was the last straw that broke the camel's back (I don't know who is the camel in this case: me or the keyboard).Other thoughts: I still don't undersstand why Micorsoft started putting a lifting bar to elevate the row QWERTY as oppoesed the row ZXCVB in the early models - this strains the wrists even more!",1290902400

For first time Ergo users it takes some getting used to especially with the reverse angle spacer on the front but your wrists will thank you if you leave it on. I have used others including the ""wave"" and it's just not even a close match. Don't buy the Desktop 7000, even though the keyboard looks the same the wireless version misses keystrokes quite often.

I was eyeing up this 4000 for a while now, waiting for it to go on sale.  A competitor (blue & yellow anyone) had it for $29.99 this week, so I ran out and got it.I really like the feel of it, the keys are solid and I really do like the split it gives.  Some of the keys are a little larger (H & N) and they take a little getting used to, but overall it's a great keyboard.I really like the new ""function"" keys that the keyboard has.  Basically it reassigns all of the F1-F12 keys to various functions that work with all sorts of programs and you can customize them if you like.The two things I wish this keyboard did were 1) serve as a USB hub like my old Natural Keyboard did, and 2) I wish the Zoom key worked as a scroller rather than just zooming in and out on images.  It will scroll with Word 2007 and Outlook 2007, I am not having any luck with IE 7, even though I did install the keyboard software today at version 6.1 (latest and greatest).Other than that, it's a great change from my old keyboard.  The new wrist pad at the bottom is cushioned and should wear just as well as the old hard plastic.  It definitely feels better on my wrists - that's for sure.  I did remove the wrist lifter on the bottom of the keyboard.  I just didn't like being at that angle. Maybe I'll try it again later, but for now I prefer it to be where my old keyboard was.Microsoft has another winner on it's hand.  I also like that it's not wireless.  I sit at my desk when I work, I have no need for wireless.  To me, that's just crazy - one more thing I need to remember to charge or else I'm sitting cold turkey.

Some warned me about poor responsibility of the space bar. It was OK. But after a month and a half after the purchase, I found the ""b"" key was not being responsive.

The call got answered in a few minutes and the talk went smooth. But in the end, they wanted it to be shipped to them at *my cost* before sending me a replacement. Maybe it's the current industry standard practice but I found that pretty bad one.I ended up doing some physical hacking and doing my own fix.If I'm not happy with that hack, maybe I will buy a new one, not bothering with shipping it back.Come on, shipping it back is ~$10 shipping plus finding correct boxes and trips to/from the shipping place.

For about a month, I used this as my primary keyboard.  Then, I happily unplugged it and am hoping now to find it a new home.I could handle the sheer bulk of it, though I didn't care for it.  I even got used to the fact that I often mistyped things (I use a sort of modified touch typing method where the finger closest to the key in question hits it rather than the ""right"" finger) because of the curved layout.What I couldn't get used to was the feeling that I needed to reach down into the keyboard (because of the length wrist rest) and pound the keys to get them to register.  The space bar was especially problematic. I couldn't just ""tap it"".  I had to whack it pretty hard, and even then it often didn't register. I ended up going from a touch typist who didn't have to look at the keyboard often to someone who had to keep staring at the keyboard to figure out where the heck some of the keys were or why I kept getting a B when I wanted an N.It may have helped shoulder and wrist pain a bit, but it caused my fingers to hurt terribly from having to hit the keys harder than I liked.Apart from those complaints, the keyboard worked as designed, required no special installation effort on Windows 7 x64, and the various little extra buttons all did what they were supposed to do.For now, I've gone back to my Logitech G15 which isn't ideal but suits me a lot more than this one did.",1301356800

"11 2, 2013","[1, 1]",1.0,Eww just ew,B000A6PPOK,Amazon Customer,A3NLI44GQY8K48,"I am going to type this review on a different keyboard that has random keys that don't work because it is preferable to the new Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 that I just bought (and have subsequently filed to return). I have been using a Microsoft Comfort Curve 2000 for many years. It has served me well, and I can type really fast on it. I don't measure my WPMs but I type considerably fast you'll just have to take my word for it. I bought this keyboard thinking it would be the next iteration. Newer = better, right? I was sorely mistaken. I gave it a week and I hate this board, and I am willing to bet you will too, unless your hand is already severely deformed in a matching arc to fit this keyboard.PROs:It's a keyboard, and has tons of multimedia buttons. The full number pad worked well, but that's because Microsoft didn't try to do anything fancy with it. It's sleek, shiny, and black and not polka dotted or striped. And the wrist rest is some super lush exotic material that feels softer than a baby's bottom. But, that's about it for pros.CONs:As mentioned throughout the other reviews here, this keyboard has a really crappy space bar. I read this and thought maybe it wouldn't bother me, but it did. Not only is the space bar really hard to push down, but when you do it makes a really loud sound that is not a click, or a push, but a really unnatural sound as if you are breaking the button. I obviously did not wear the keyboard in to see if this went away but other reviews don't mention it going away.I am a gamer. I hear you judging me, ""So why buy an ergonomic keyboard then?"" Well, I'm also a web programmer. (And btw the Comfort Curve 2000 keyboard was amazing and was NOT uncomfortable for gaming.) Anyway, the positioning of the WASD keys is perfect. However, if you are in a game where you need CTRL, SHIFT, or the space bar, you may run into issues. I had difficulty hitting those keys properly. And in a game where I had to hold ALT to run, the key did not register properly. I had to remove my hands from other keys so I could push down on ALT with all of my might in order for it to register and stay down.I also have another issue. I'm including it, but not blaming it on the keyboard. It's apparently just a typing ""quirk"" that I have. I find that I hit a few keys ""improperly"" such as I hit the B key with my left hand. Doesn't seem that I always do this, but I apparently do it enough and with this keyboard it is impossible to do. I get that it forces you to type properly, but I don't like to conform, and I just couldn't get used to this change.The multimedia keys were great. Except it is impossible to hit any of them reliably. You will have to turn on a light to be able to distinguish them. And, if your keyboard is on a keyboard tray like mine, that means pulling it out all the way to be able to get to those keys. (This is a big, clunky keyboard.) Not to mention, for you keyboard tray users, make sure that the arc will fit under your keyboard tray. The keyboard comes with an attachable foot to raise it up, but this raises the keyboard up so high that it won't fit under the desk. Also, I found that it raised the keyboard at such an odd angle, that it was as if you were trying to type with a wall in front of you. You know when your cat is in front of you and you're trying to keep typing while arcing your arms over the cat's back? Yeah, that's what this feels like. And you don't get the adorable cat.Other questionable decisions: I didn't like that the F1-F12 keys all had the numbers hidden on the recessed side of the key instead of the face. And the ESC key seemed to be floating on an island where it was difficult to press. Oh and the CAPS lock and SCROLL lock lights being right at the front, well it was kind of annoying to have them shining there constantly. I like them at the top of a keyboard so I can push them under the desk ledge and not have to see them.Overall this was a horrible decision. The 2000 keyboard series is not being made anymore, so I am going to try the 3000 and hope it is better. Until then, I type on a Logitech mini keyboard and my hands hurt like hell. OW!",1383350400
"04 18, 2007","[1, 1]",5.0,Great keyboard! Very comfortable!,B000A6PPOK,Amazon Customer,AATEWUN78BXC1,"I could never use the Microsoft Natural Keyboards, the ones with the big ugly split, which felt anything but natural to me. But I tried out the Microsoft Comfort Curve keyboards, which curve but are pretty flat, and liked them. Then I tried this one and liked it even more. After using it for about three weeks I want to buy another one for my office at work.Some of the Comfort Curve keyboards are just too thin; their key travel is so short it's like your fingers are walking on concrete. But the key travel on this one is very very nice. Also, many of the other Microsoft keyboards have an usuable layout of the Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up, Page Down keys. This one has the classic, correct, layout. The wrist rest is also surprisingly comfotable. Microsoft really did a great job on this one!Some minor negatives: 1) It's usb only, and won't work with a USB-to-PS2 adaptor.2) The program that allows you to program the extra multimedia keys isn't particularly flexible.3) The function keys have the keyname (F1, F2, etc.,) on the front, where it's hard to read of the lighting isn't good.UPDATE August 2012: Five years later this keyboard is still going strong. I'm a programmer and am on the keyboard either at the office or at home every day for hours on end. I guess I'd been taking the keyboard for granted, but last week I traveled to a different office to do some work, and they didn't have this keyboard.

So I went around to a few stores and quickly tested out all the keyboards that were out on display.  This happened to be the single one that got my attention, strictly based on how it felt under my fingers and that the clack of the keys was considerably muted compared to the others.I've had two qualms with it:1) because it is an ergonomic keyobard and so that keys are divided into two sets, I have learned that I used to hit the ""B"" key with my right hand, which is not really allowed with an ergonomic keyboard.  but that's my problem.2) the spacebar is harder to press than necessary.  I think I've gotten used to it pretty quickly though, because I don't notice that anymore.  But that was my biggest immediate concern when I first set it up on my desk.I kept the plastic stand under it for the first few weeks... I kind of liked that downward slope angle..  But then I tried without, and the keyboard definitely sits nicer on my lap when there's no stand under it (there are two built-in flip-up short legs on the back also... that's cool.)This is also my first Microsoft keyboard..  not too shabby...I'm quite happy with this keyboard. :)",1145836800

If you are a hunt a pecker type, might be a little more difficult.No real problems with sticky keys, space bar can snag a bit if hit at a wrong angle.Down side-I tried installing the MS drivers for this and had many issues.

It works very well, and is extremely comfortable to use.It has 2 flaws:1) The letters/numbers rub off the keys, and relatively quickly. This will make the keyboard unusable for those who 'hunt & peck'. But if you type from key memory, it's not really much of an issue.2) And this is the BIG flaw... It's more sensitive to moisture than any other piece of electronics I've ever owned. Anyone who's used computers for a long time has at some point dumped a full cup of something onto their keyboard. I've done it more often than I care to admit. Other keyboards I've owned were surprisingly forgiving about this kind of thing, and usually go back to working ok once they dry out. In contrast: The MS4000 keyboard will be completely bricked if you get even a few drops of moisture between the keys. And I mean anywhere, between any of the keys, the whole keyboard is kind of a timebomb waiting for a few drops of moisture to commit sepuku with. Considering how a keyboard is made, you'd almost have to deliberately try to make something as sensitive to moisture as the ms4000.This assessment is based on owning 3 (three) ms4000 keyboards over the past 7 years. I'm currently typing on a $10 logitech entry level keyboard which is no where near as comfortable to use. I'd much rather be typing on an ms4000, but I'm getting really sick of the built-in obsolescence in them. Toying with the idea of rearranging my desk area to allow a completely separate surface for drinks... but I'm kind of irked at MS for making the ms4000 so sensitive to moisture touching it in any way, that it almost has to be deliberate.

After about one week of not-very-intense use I had to stop using this apparently well made but horribly designed keyboard.  The use of my right hand and arm became painful.  There were three main problems:#1 The amount of thumb pressure required to actually register the &#34;space&#34; key was way too much to type with any comfort or confidence.  Even if I concentrated on always striking the space key so that a space would be inserted into the text or computer code where needed, I found that about 1-in-12 or 1-in-14 attempted spaces would not be inserted.  It is terrible that part of one's brain must focus on striking the space key with heavy force; it is even worse that one must proof read each page of text or code to ensure that spaces have been inserted where needed.#2 The space key is intrinsically badly designed anyway, because one wants this key to be equally welcoming to both the left and right thumbs.  It isn't.  I found that my right thumb worked best, requiring unnatural contortions to ensure spaces were inserted where needed.#3 In general, I found that the $10 keyboard Dell included with my latest XPS desktop requires a more comfortable amount of force for ALL of the keys, not just the space key.  This could be because the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 for Business requires greater downward movement of the keys for a stroke to be registered.Problems #1 and #2 are so severe that I found this keyboard simply unusable.  This is quite an indictment for a way-above-average-cost keyboard that is allegedly designed and built with proper ergonomics in mind.  I am astounded that so many users find this a comfortable keyboard.  By the way, during more than half of my PC and computer keyboard use, which dates back to the late 1970s, I have actually used (and preferred) Logitech and especially Microsoft ergonomic keyboards.  This is the first ergonomic keyboard I have ever used that I have found to be a thinly disguised implement of torture for thumb, hand, and arm.I now have some appreciation for the feelings of the other one-star and two-star reviewers when they read the patronizing remarks of the many keyboarders who find this device comfortable.  Some seem to pooh-pooh (usually in patronizing terms) those of us who find this one of the most wretched keyboards we have ever encountered.  It is a little hard to believe we sufferers happened to receive slightly defective devices.  The complaint I offer can be found too often in the reviews for our complaint to occur as a result of a minor or rare manufacturing defect.On the plus side, the build quality appears to be terrific.",1384041600

I found it a bit amusing that it had a warning label on it talking about things like carpal tunnel and other muscular disorders etc. There is a reason this sticker is there, it is because the space bar on this thing is so far beyond bad that if you use this for more than a few hours you will get carpal tunnel. Keep in mind that the space bar is quite possibly the most commonly used key!If you look around the internet you will see people trying to fix this things space bar. Just do a quick search. If you are the type of person that wants to pry off the space bar on a brand new keyboard by all means go for it, this is the perfect product for you. As for me, I feel at the price of this product the whole thing should be amazing.Who would I recommend this to? People who want carpal tunnel surgery.For a better solution see also the Perixx PERIBOARD ergonomic model. It has a split space bar that you won't have to fix and is simply amazing.Thank you German product engineers and shame on you Microsoft for this insufferable &#34;ergo&#34; nightmare.",1392768000

The number pad makes it far too large width-wise, putting the mouse way out. The keys feel good - not clicky at all, kind of gummy in fact, but not unpleasantly so. They press fairly easily, with the sole exception of this keyboards biggest problem - the spacebar. Due mostly to this, I picked up a kinesis freestyle. This is the last thing I am typing with the 4000 due to the spacebar, but I do not hate it - for those who don't want to pay $140 for the equivalent kinesis product, I would certainly recommend trying the 4000. It has a very premium look and feel, works well with both Macs and PCs, and is well thought out.

The first one I got for my office at work, and the second for my office at home.  One I love and one I hate.  There is clearly a problem with Microsoft's quality control with these keyboards.First off, I've been a user of the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro for years -- they are no longer available, and I bought five of them when the product was discontinued years ago.  I'm down to my last two somewhat clean keyboards.  The main thing I've been looking for in a new ergonomic keyboard is the correct setup for the arrow keys, with left, down, and right in a straight row, and up right above down (follow that?).  The 4000 has that, plus the curved split keyboard that I have really come to love.The 4000 I have at work, the first one I got, is great.  All the keys have a fairly consistent feel and are quiet.  I preferred the utility button layout of the older Natural Keyboard Pro, and rather wish the function keys had their normal functions on the top (F1, F2, etc.) rather than the ""make it easy"" labels which only work on some programs, but otherwise, it's a perfectly adequate replacement.The one I got more recently at home has one of the problematic spacebars.  It's LOUD.  If all the keys were this loud, it wouldn't be a problem, but it's very annoying and distracting to be typing and have a very loud slam/click every time I hit a space.  I pulled the spacebar key off a few times and tried to fix it, so far to no avail.  Finally I unplugged the new keyboard and went back to one of my remaining Natural Keyboard Pro copies.It's hard for me to believe that computer keyboards have been around for more than 40 years and yet they still can't get such a simple thing right.In summary, I give one my copies of this keyboard 4 stars, and the other 1 star!",1290556800

When you press it from left or right, it made a loud crack sound and was very hard to press. You need to press it in the center of it to make the space bar act likes a normal key instead of cheap one. I was going to return it and exchange it with another one because I though it was defected product.But I read a online review that this was normal and couldn't not be fix. But since I don't want to go though with mailing back the huge keyboard box with boxed in 2' by 3' box(amazon shipped with a huge brown box). I decided to keep it for a few day.I decided to reattach the raise keyboard stand below just to try it out. And it turned out that if you place your hand properly on the raised stand, this is the most comfortable typing style I have ever try it before. you need to put both of your two elbows on the table and type as if you would play with crystal ball like a gypsies.That the first improvement I noticed it and I decided to try it for a few more day. I am computer science student and because of my condition I need to use ergonomic wrist glove to type. Every since I found out that how to type properly on the raised stand, I don't need to wear that glove. Now that loud sound from space bar disappeared and space bar act likes rest of the keys. And I don't need to press hard when I press from left or right, it must have grease it self and it sort out itself.That is so cool! Before I buy this keyboard I was having hard time choosing between this one and Logitech wave keyboard. I took this for the raise stand I am glad I made that decision.Only con thing I could thing of is this, Zoom button in the middle of the keyboard, only zoom in internet explorer. Since I use firefox it only scroll down the webpage instead of zooming. I realized I run out of customized short cut keys,too.

Could be useful in some web situations. I like the indicator lights in the middle of the keyboard's hand rest as well.I bought this keyboard on two occasions for two VERY different prices. Here on Amazon a few months back for $34 and on newegg (on sale) a few days ago for $19.99. I thought it was well worth my money for $34 and i thought it was a steal at $20.

I find it perhaps the best I've ever used in terms of ergonomics and feel.As with all ergonomic designs, it takes a few days to get used to it, and people who don't touch type probably won't care for it. However, I started using one of the original Microsoft Natural Keyboards in 1995, and as a writer I think it's one of the best decisions I ever made. I've never had the first trace of carpal tunnel stress.This model is wired with a USB plug, and after trying some wireless ergonomic keyboards, I came back to the wired version. The wire is a minor annoyance, and having to change batteries in the wireless version is a bigger one.The layout is fine, with one major objection. All later versions of the Microsoft ergonomic line change the way functions keys are used in a very stupid way. People who need ergonomic keyboards are generally quite familiar with Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-Z and other shortcuts for common operations (Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo for the four listed). The new arrangement for function keys duplicates those operations on the function keys, but you have to remove your hand from the keyboard to get to them, which is vastly inferior. Plus, that's the default when the keyboard is turned on, and so if you are accustomed to using some function key operations in programs such as Microsoft Word, you have to press the F Lock key to switch the functions keys back to normal usage. That would be fine, except that when you do that, the PrtScn no longer works until you press F Lock again to switch back to default mode. Fixing this annoyance requires first installing Intellitype (which you can download from Microsoft), and then doing a patch to remap keys, which is available on the web. I can't put links in product reviews, but I can tell you that the search you want is ""F Lock Key Eliminator"".The other major issue with this model is reliability. I'm getting less than two years of usage out of each one, and that's not full time because I move from computer to computer depending on what I'm doing. I got one with a bad space bar that never did work quite right. Two others have failed with keys that just stop working or become intermittent. It's possible that this comes from build up of dust and detritus in the keyboard - my office is dusty and I'm not fastiduous about cleaning the keyboard. But it didn't happen with my older models.However, these little guys are pretty cheap, so I've just been keeping one in reserve at all times and ordering another when one fails. It's worth it to me to get the smooth action and nice ergonomic layout.A few miscellaneous notes: the keyboard has play/pause and volume up-down keys for media, but nothing to advance media as some of the other Microsoft keyboards have. Instead it has five programmable keys, but if there's a way to make them work as for media forward/back I have not found it. There are also dedicated keys for bringing up a browser to your home page, and for search, email, and calculator. Finally, there's a handy mute key to silence your speakers, and I love having that to silence things when I get a phone call. The dedicated keys can be reprogrammed to other functions with Intellitype. Finally, the keyboard has back and forward buttons beneath the space bar where you can thumb them, and a zoom slider in the middle (between the separated banks of keys) but if it works with any piece of software I've ever owned, I have not been able to detect it. You might as well pretend it's not there.All in all, this is a pretty cheap way to find out if you like ergonomic keyboards.",1262131200

Jones,A2R7B3MUR22USI,"Several years ago I had one of the first Microsoft ergonomic keyboards with a PS/2 style connector.I really liked that keyboard.For whatever reason, I moved away from the ergonomics and have had standard keyboards for a while now. My Dell keyboard recently gave up the ghost so I decided to go back to a Microsoft ergonomic and settled on this one.There are nice touches, such as the scroll knob in the middle of the keyboard and the padded palm rest.But the keyboard itself has a cheap feel to it (much cheaper than the Dell keyboard I was using) and the keys are a bit mushy...But the space bar is *horrible*.When you press the space bar with your right thumb it feels awful, it makes a loud click, and sometimes it just doesn't work.I'll keep trying to get used to the keyboard becauseA) I like the feel of the ergonomic layout.B) It's a little bit of a hassle to return to Amazon just because I have to head out to the UPS store.C) The price was low enough to take a chance.The biggest drawback is the space bar. Maybe it needs a breaking in period but I have a feeling it'll just get worse.01/12/12 - Just a quick update to my original review. I googled for ""microsoft 4000 keyboard space bar"" and there are a LOT of reports of this issue out there. Not sure why Microsoft hasn't fixed it yet. At any rate, here's what worked for me.If you pop off the space bar there are a couple of tiny triangular tabs - one underneath the 'N' key and one underneath the 'B' key. The one under the 'N' key was broken and hanging on. As many commenters in my search recommended, I removed it and cut off the one under the B key as well. This has helped the space bar a lot, though it's not perfect. It's definitely much better now.10/16/12 - A couple of months ago I gave up on this keyboard entirely. The noise that the space bar makes was driving me nuts. It's such a shame these issues haven't been addressed yet but I've gone back to a standard layout Dell keyboard and am much happier.",1326240000

The one they sent me didn't work at all. I got a refund, but wasted a lot of time.The one from amazon came before the promised delivery time, which was good. This worked right out of the box. On the contrary to most reviews I read for this keyboard, it didn't take me any time at all to get acquainted with the new layout/contour.I ordered a kensington full size mouse to go with this, a Belkin WaveRest gel mouse pad, and a belkin usb hub to have it all connected.I haven't had any problems with my wrists any more.

"12 18, 2013","[0, 1]",4.0,Well Worth Its 2013-Price,B000A6PPOK,B.L.,A2XIOXRRYX0KZY,"When this first came out, I didn't think it was worth it's original retail price at all. The general design is nice. I'm a fan of the concept of including some tilt and splitting the keys to make it possible to hold your hands in a fairly relaxed position. The physical build of the keyboard itself just didn't seem to be quite up to par with the price. I've been using the one I have now for several months and the space bar has never really felt great. I got used to it and I adjust for it now, but it's just now quite as easy to press down smoothly as the ones I've had on other keyboards. It feels like it has too much wiggle room.At its current prices, though, it's not hugely more expensive than the really rock bottom cheap keyboards that don't have any ergonomic features. If you're doing an awful lot of typing (which happens to me at times) this is definitely worth it.A big downside you should note is that this thing is pretty darn big. It's a full-sized keyboard with the number pad to the side, plus extra height and width added for the ergonomic features. If you have your keyboard tray in a tight space or very limited room on your desk, that might be an issue.This also has a bunch of smart feature keys, but honestly their responsiveness seems to vary. The ones that pop open windows do great, but the volume keys are often very slow to do anything (on a Win 7 computer). I truly don't know if it's interference with something else installed on my machine, or if it's just something about how the keyboard drivers get along with Win 7. I've basically just given up on hitting those buttons.On the whole, if you want a keyboard that has some ergonomics going for it and isn't hugely expensive (for example, if you have a history of spilling drinks on keyboards and don't want to put $100 into one) this is a good option.If you need something wireless, or small, or you don't do much typing and don't want to adjust to a slightly modified layout (keys are in the same spots relative to each other, but that split in the middle takes a little adjustment for your muscle memory) you should look at something else.",1387324800

The keys do not feel stiff at all, they're light, very quiet, and responsive (for the most part--see below).  Space bar is not an issue for me at all.What IS an issue is the M and N key don't always register, at least on my particular unit.  I'm typing along, and one of my words is ""missig"" the N.  And for some reason, the N key is the loudest key on the keyboard.  Also, on one occasion, the "")"" key stopped working entirely.  I could type a ""0"", but holding shift to get "")"" didn't work.  Rebooting fixed it..very odd.Maybe the keys are stiff, and I'm just used to crappy keyboards. :)  I'm a fairly fast typist (85-100wpm or so), so if anyone has suggestions for a comfortable (ergonomic), highly responsive and fluid keyboard, post a comment here.",1168387200

So far, I do like it for the comfort.  It does take getting used to, however, but when you adjust, you won't want to go back to a regular keyboard.The keyboard is sloped on both sides to make it easier to type, compared to just the regular kind that everyone uses.  The extender that comes with it can be detached, but it's only for people who want to type in a downward angle.  I had no use for it, so I took that off.Customizing the buttons is very simple. The Back/Forward buttons on the bottom can be changed to Previous/Next if you want to use them for your media players, which is what I did.  The 5 buttons at the top can be programed to open applications or your Favorites. Sadly the Zoom scroller only zooms in on the text instead of scrolling up and down on web pages. Very sad waste of what could have been a very useful key.I guess my only gripe about this keyboard is the the spacebar really needs a good pounding before it starts to loosen up.  Even as I type this now, I'm still missing some space strokes from time to time.  Also, this keyboard doesn't come with a PS2 adapter, nor will it work for one either.  Make sure you have an open USB slot because that's all it has to plug into your computer.  I didn't mind that at all since I have several unused slots.Overall, however, I really would recommend this keyboard to anyone who wants to try something different, and to improve his or her typing skills.

Simply put, the 4000 is wonderful to type with.  I particularly like how the keyboard includes the removable elevator for the heel of your hands.  At first, it's a little awkward having a keyboard that slopes slightly downward, but I've found I actually prefer this arrangement to the original natural keyboard.  If you don't like it, it's removable so you can have it set up just like the original.The keyboard makes no attempt to reinvent the wheel.  The arrow keys are inverted-T arrangement, the F keys are large and easy to press, and the number keypad is top-notch.  There is just enough positive feedback when pressing the keys to make effective touch typing easy.I type 150 wpm on a slow day and I've got one of these at both my offices and at my home.  It's corded, so no batteries to replace.  It looks different and always catches everyone's attention when they see it on your desk.I intend on stockpiling these for future use, just as I did when the original natural keyboard was discontinued.

The split layout is wonderful on the wrists, but a disaster for those who have to hunt-and-peck.

I am one of those people that do not enjoy typing on a laptop keyboard since it's too small.  I want that nice key stoke feedback from a full size keyboard and always liked the Microsoft Keyboard product offerrings.  When I came upon this one I was thinking how in the world am I going to type in this weird ergonomic position.  A couple of days later, I realized how could I have not been typing this way for so long.  Initially it does need some getting used too, but someone must have done the reasearch, since once you get started you will not want to go back to a normal position keyboard.  I also hope I am preventing further long term issues for my fingers, hands and wrists by typing in this ergo position, but for now I continue to like the feeback of the key strokes and at least mentally I believe I am typing even quicker and with more accuracy (I thank my lucky stars that I took Senior Year High School Typing Class!).The existence of a wrist pad is always good, but there is a plastic platform that can be installed underneath the keyboad to raise it off the surface which then angles your typing downwards in a supposed better ergo position.  I did notice there is no SLEEP button like from my previous keyboard, but you soon forget about this and just either use your mouse or close your laptop cover.In addition I have to say that I like the additional email function keys to further reduce your time using the mouse.  Especially that ""SEND"" button.

I tried to use my old Microsoft Multimedia keyboard but couldn't find an adapter that would make it work on a USB port (I tried 2 different ones), so I thought I would try to make the leap to a more ""ergonomic"" keyboard layout. I bought this one based on other people's reviews. I have been typing on the straight-line layout for 23 years, so I expected to have to adjust to the different layout, but when I tried it out by typing a 3-page letter in Word, I began having the classic carpal tunnel pain for the first time. By the time I was through with the letter, I had pain shooting up to my shoulder and my wrists hurt as well. I seem to have injured myself using this ""ergonomic"" keyboard while I have never injured myself with the ""straight-line"" layout.I ended up selling this model, took a small loss on it, and then ordered the Microsoft Digital Media Pro keyboard, which I am happy with and seems to be better for me than this one.The wrist rest on this keyboard is nice. As others have noted, the space bar is hard to tap and takes more force than it should. Much of the functionality of this model is also present on the Digital Media Pro model (hot keys, zoom, ""favorites"" buttons, etc.) and I am much happier with the touch and feel of the Digital Media Pro model than I was with this one. For me, it was a disaster! Obviously other people use it and like it, so each person will have to decide for themselves. It came as a big surprise that ""ergonomic"" was not helpful for me.I also had trouble with the curved surface because my fingers didn't go to the right places. If I had not experienced so much pain so quickly, I might have tried retraining myself to the new layout, but since I found something else that works better for me, it didn't seem like the way to go.",1184284800

This keyboard is one of the most comfortable on the market.  Personally, I like the layout of the keys, the responsiveness, and the overall shape of the keyboard.  Unfortunately, there are systemic quality control problems which will require that you replace this keyboard every few months.First, the keys will rub off within a few weeks. There is no way around this.  I have purchased 5 of these keyboards, and without fail, all the keys rub off within a few weeks, making the keyboard very difficult to use.  The other issue is responsiveness of the keys fails: the keys become stiffer and stiffer leaving the keyboard unusable.

"10 18, 2005","[853, 874]",5.0,Best Overall Keyboard to Date,B000A6PPOK,"Charles Chen ""Keyboard Jockey""",AILCWT1IIP7ZT,"As a software developer, I am literally attached to my keyboard.  On a typical day, I'll spend anywhere between 5-8 hours typing, so it's of critical importance that the keyboard I use is comfortable.  As most programmers and typists can attest, the Microsoft Ergo series of keyboards is the best keyboard for prolonged use.Having used the Ergo keyboards in some form or another for the past 4 years (most recently, the Wireless Elite set), I must say that this keyboard is a step above.To begin with, the construction is very solid.  There is far less flex in the plastic and the keyboard as a whole compared to my Wireless Elite.  The wrist pad is made of a nicely textured faux leather material with a tiny bit of padding.  It feels rather durable (not to mention comfortable).  It's a good addition as one of my main gripes with the MS ergo keyboards was that it was hard to fit one of those gel wrist rests around the curved base of the keyboard.Compared to previous MS keyboards that I've owned, the keys on this keyboard are very well damped in terms of the sound the produce.  It's very muted, even with my hard strokes.  One thing that will take some adjusting to is the increased curvature (along two different planes) between where your pinky and index fingers rest (A,F and J,;).  Whereas the older keyboards have a relatively flat incline, this keyboard has a slight curve (concave).  In addition, there is also a very subtle curve across the keyboard as well (a horizontal curvature), which seems a more natural fit for the shape of hands.  Also of note is the fact that some of the keys have changed shape.  Whereas previously, MS had kept the striking surface consistent across the different keys (even at the edge), this keyboard has several keys along the ridge that have different striking surfaces.Interestingly, this keyboard also features the return of the front riser (available on the older versions of the MS ergo keyboards).  Actually, in recent months, I've been doing exactly this, but with my own ad hoc methods :) This is a much better solution.  The riser is easily removable for those that prefer the standard configurations.Note that this keyboard is *USB only*, which means that it may be incompatible with some older motherboards.  Not a problem for me as I'm using it with a newer laptop.  The keyboard does come with software for the programmable keys and extra functions, but it's plug and play right out of the box with WinXP.I also appreciate the new forward and back buttons for use with web browsing (work with no drivers).  The zoom slider in the middle of the keyboard, however, seems inapproriately used.  It would have been much more useful as a scroll slider instead.Sizewise, it takes up slightly more surface space than my wireless elite, but is much, much thinner.My only complaints are that the space key is a little bit stiff out of the box (maybe it'll loosen up a bit after usage), the distance from Ctrl to the number keys seems to have increased a bit (on the scale of millimeters, this is important for those of us hitting Ctrl+F5 quite often ;-), the Delete key is now the same size as the other keys in the cluster (which some people may prefer, but I need to adjust to due to the extra large delete key on the Wireless Elite set), the Enter key is slightly smaller (by 3-5mm), and the key response is not as ""soft"" as say the ones I recently sampled on the MS bluetooth keyboard, but still very comfortable.Overall, a very high quality keyboard.  If you can wait, there is sure to be a wireless version coming soon.  But anyone that spends a significant amount of type working with computers will be able to appreciate the new layout after 1-2 days of adjustment to the new curvature.  I'm very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this keyboard to my fellow programmers :)UPDATE: In the past few days, I've had an inquiry into whether I'm still satisfied with the keyboard.  The answer is a big, bold *YES*.  As I was telling a colleague, this keyboard simply rocks.  I can type hours on end without pain.  My ""seat of the pants"" impression is that I also type _faster_ with this keyboard.  As I pointed out above, I think that most people will have to go through a period of adjustment to really feel comfortable and fall  in love with this keyboard, even if you're coming from a previous Microsoft Ergo series keyboard.",1129593600

I won't use anything else on any of my home computers unless I am forced to (when it breaks)My only gripe with this keyboard is the CLEANING. Good lord. Let me preface this by saying I am very careful taking apart electronics, I dismantle computers and other electronics as well as build them. This thing just HATES to be touched. I have owned 2 of these, and the only time they stop working is when I pull them apart to clean it.My first one I pulled apart and cleaned, but about half the keys stopped working for no reason. Albeit I may have touched the tracers leading to the keys and other things, but I wasn't rough with it nor pulled things apart.My second one, I had got so filthy I couldn't stand it, (a few days ago) so I took it apart. I never touched a single piece of the electronic hardware. (Note: When you unscrew the bottom, the key top part separates from the bottom part with all the hardware, so you can just clean the top part without messing with the bottom part) I spent a good 2-3 hours taking the keys off one by one, putting them in warm soapy water, then cleaning them, letting them dry, and re-assembling them. I blew some canned air on the bottom part (underneath the electronics where the dust settles) and then put it back together. Mission accomplished!

I do transcription work, I haven't been able to become fully adjusted to the arrangement of the keys.  For some reason, the right hand is causing more problems than the left.  The biggest pains are the number 6 key, and the distance between the arrow keys and the alpha keypad.  Secondly, I wear a wrist brace and while using this keyboard I can't wear it.  And even though the design is ergonomic, since I do have some minor repetitive stress discomfort, it would be better if I could still use my wrist brace.  The way the keyboard is designed makes it uncomfortable to use it, putting my wrist in an uncomfortable position.  Overall, I gave it three stars because of these concerns.

It maybe isn't the quietest keyboard in the world, but that is the only thing that I could even remotely call a ""con"". Installation was a piece of cake, not difficult at all.

The keys move freely and retract back to position immediately when you release pressure unlike cheap keyboards which tend to have friction and don't retract immediately.

If you spend a lot of time typing, this may be just what you need. However... there is one major flaw: the space bar. It often sticks or is slow to come back up & it makes a clacking sound each time you press it. I considering sending it back, but after doing an online search discovered this keyboard problem has existed for years. There are numerous pages with ""fixes"" for the problem.While I will not recommend my solution (because it seems absurd to be fixing a new keyboard), here is what I did to fix my space bar:I love to kayak fish, so of course I always have some 303 Protectant on hand. I discovered years ago that cleaning my PC trackballs with 303 made 'em very slick, so I figured whatever was sticking on the keyboard could be ""303ed"".The space bar came right off using a small bent screwdriver. I was careful not to bend the small steel tension bar underneath & pried the space bar up side to side so it didn't come off at an angle. I found that the ""clacking"" is caused by the bottom of the space bar hitting against a plastic surface, so this was an easy fix with a piece of sticky-back Velcro. I used a cotton swab to apply 303 to the plastic posts & inserts (1 center, 2 smaller each side of space bar) & also put some at the little tension bar pivot points for good measure. It's been several weeks now & the space bar hasn't stuck once & I sure don't miss that clacking either.I really don't understand why Microsoft hasn't fixed this problem.

I don't even need to stretch anymore.The raised front is weird at first, but I was completely used to it and the split keyboard after about 1 week.It should be noted that when mine first arrived it had a weird behavior that whenever i'd hit the spacebar not exactly in the middle (95% of the time), it would hit the alt button on the right side.  This went away after about 2 weeks of use.  Could probably take a nail file and file the front right corner of the spacebar where it was hitting the alt key and save yourself the week of aggravation.  That's what I'll do next time - didn't want to this time in case I returned it.I have my laptop up about 5"" so this can fit under it, so the volume keys on the keyboard are a welcome addition.  The calculator button gets a lot of use as well.Other Con is the stupid F Lock key.  I'm not sure why it's there, or why it's so close to the oft-used ""prtscn"" button.

Yost,ABDFB5WZ5MYCR,"Five stars! - and for me five stars has to meet certain requirements (read below if you're interested in why/how I rate things).I own three of these keyboards: one for my laptop at work, one for my desktop at home and a 2nd keyboard at home for the work laptop. The keyboard is comfortable and I especially appreciate the wrist rest. The option to elevate the front of the keyboard is an added plus, although I have to admit not using it considering my height and the heights of my chair and desk. For taller/shorter users it may provide the optimal angle.The other bonus for this keyboard: the extra buttons along the top edge. The mute button is extremely useful at work. I've also programmed the ""My Favorites"" buttons for those programs I use all the time.Installation via the USB plug is easy and it takes just a second or two for the system to recognize the keyboard (I'm running Windows 7).One hint suggestion: Download the Microsoft IntelliType software - it makes setting up the keyboard and all those extra buttons a breeze. (Type Microsoft IntelliType into Google and select the'Software Downloads | Microsoft Hardware' link. Select the 'Keyboards' tab then look for the Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 link; or try cutting & pasting this: [...]).Another useful tip: clean the wrist rest every other day - I use Clorox wipes. I've found this keeps the wrist rest clean and free of oils & dust (dead skin cells).One other note regarding the issues that serveral users have experienced: The space bar is a bit stiff, but it loosened up after 2-3 weeks. I have noticed some fading of the letters, but this has only been after several years of daily use (I've had my work keyboard for almost three years). I have one keyboard crap out on me after a year (my home keyboard); one phone call to Microsoft had a replacement shipped out and I received it within a week.Overall a great keyboard - if I had to pick one 'Con' I would say the keyboard itself has a rather large footprint (set aside at least an 11""x20"" area on your desk). Considering the usefulness of the wrist rest and the extra buttons, this is a very minor issue.5 Star Requirements- Price point must be reasonable (I'd expect a $500 keyboard to be great)- Must hold up to daily use with no (or very few) issues- Must be easy to use (e.g., I don't have to sing while standing on one leg to get it to work)- Must perform as advertised (none of this ""your experience may vary"" crap)- Must have a bonus feature I find valuable (e.g. the mute button on this keyboard)",1358899200

My hands are somewhat small so my thumbs are at the edges of the spacebar, and a regular keypress does not register as a space because of torque issues.

The combination of angled keys, wrist support, and negative tilt (decline) allowed my wrists to heal once the stresses of the old keyboard were removed.  See bottom of review for keyboard posture information.The keyboard layout has some nuances to it, the ""enter"" and ""shift"" keys on the right hand are slightly smaller than normal, and the T/G/H/N keys are a bit larger than normal.Once you get used to it the layout is great and promotes good typing habits.The mute/volume/calculator buttons are really helpful.When it broke a few years back, I ordered another.It had a serious issue - the space bar was so hard to push that I had to whack it so hard my wife could hear me from downstairs.  In fact, all the keys were difficult to push.I sent it back, and tried a few other models for a few years, none of which worked as well for me as the microsoft ergo.  I'm 6'2"" and have quite large hands, the generous wrist support area is key as it allows my wrists to be completely relaxed.I ordered another out of desperation last year, fortunately microsoft must have listened to the complaints because the keys are much easier to depress, much like the original board i had from 2006.I'm stoked to have my favorite ergo keyboard back.  When combined with good postural habits it will keep you RSI free even if you spend countless hours a day at your computer.------------------------------******posture info******------------------------------Overall posture plays a huge role in how well or poorly your wrists and hands will handle any keyboard.Arms should be relaxed, straight down from the shoulders, with elbows bent at 90 degrees or wider.Keyboard should be directly in front of you, with arms pointed in towards each other slightly so the wrists can be straight, not bent to the left or right.  The curved keyboard promotes this.Wrists should extend straight out from forearms, or be tilted slightly down, resting gently on the keyboard.Depress the keys using only enough pressure to click it completely, avoid ""pounding"" the keyboard.If there is tension in any of the muscles of your hands, wrists, arms, or upper back, eventually you will develop an RSI.

But much better than the Adesso.,B000A6PPOK,"David Hostetler ""SuperDave3006""",A23D13HKTA95WX,"I have a small collection of Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elites that I have had since, well Windows 95... I have kept them going through the use of usb to ps2 adapters, but one by one these boards are dying... I was saddened to see that Microsoft had stopped production of the USB version of these boards.The closest thing I could find to those is this board, complete with the raised front wierdness, and some actually pretty nice adjustability.I purchased a pair of these for now. Will likely buy more as the need arises. Below is the overview of what I found to be the good and the bad about them.  The first board replaced my Natural Keyboard Elite that had the 10 key portion fail on it at home. The other replaced the Adesso TruForm that was given to me by my company as an ergo board when my first Natural Elite outright died. It just wouldn't come up at all...The good.- Key layout similar to the Natural Elite. Hand and wrist position more or less unchanged.- Not white. I liked my Natural, and wanted a black one when everything changed from white to black. This board is actually fairly attractive.- Angle adjustment options. The riser on the front is removeable, there are feet under the back, so you can raise the entire thing, raise just the front, just the back, or set it level. Depending on how my hands / arms feel on a given day, I keep mine either level, or rear raised.- Overall good tactile feel to the keys. A little softer than the Natural, a LOT softer than the Addesso.- None of the keys stick. The left shift key on the Addesso sticks, ALL the time, that can be a problem when coding, or typing up long documents.- Gel cushioned wrist rests.- The standard keys / buttons at least, work with a KVM switch no problem.The bad.- First and foremost, it's not a black version of the Natural Keyboard Elite. For better or worse that board is gone. I loved my Elites, and would happily have gotten new ones.- The space bar on the right side takes more pressure than any other key to actuate on one of the boards. It is loosening up as I use it, but it does slow my typing down a bit.The weird.- Front riser block thing a ma jig. I am not sure how that could be comfortable to use. I took them off of both boards and set them aside. Seems like a HUGE waste of plastic to me.- No included driver software, but the extended functions like the Zoom slider don't work on Windows XP without an added driver.Haven't tried it on Windows 7 or Linux yet. Some of the buttons work, some don't. The little flyer in the box does a LOUSY job of explaining it.Summary.- Contstruction quality slightly below the older boards, but still far above the competing current boards.- Good feel when typing.- Sticky / too much pressure space bar out of the box is annoying. But seems to wear in fairly quickly.I have a need for 2 other keyboards, 1 for another desktop and 1 for a laptop docking station at home. I will be buying these boards again for those applications. If it weren't for the sticky spacebar, and missing driver CD I would have given this board 5 stars.***UPDATE 8/6/2013***After less than 4 months of use, the one of these I took to work (I bought two, one for home, one for the office), the letter printing on my E key is almost completely gone, and the other keys are rapidly wearing. That really is the only sign of wear. You would think Microsoft would have used something more wear resistant to make the letters on these keyboards. Oh well it still works great!",1365465600

A fairly large number of these decals (the most used keys, of course) wore off within months, on my first keyboard. I am a touch typist, so this problem isn't as serious for me as it would be for someone who doesn't touch type, by the way.And the space bar is a little loud, I agree with the other complaints about this problem, but I'm not sure it needs to be split, although the length of the bar does seem perhaps to be contributing to the noise issue.  For sure, the space bar needs to be quieter and somewhat easier to activate.

Keys are spongy and require a good bit of force to press. The worst offender is the space bar, which, as other reviewers have noted, is wobbly and unresponsive if pressed anywhere other than in the middle (and, given the split design, the middle is a difficult and impractical spot to hit). The space bar also rattles quite loudly, which may not be appreciated in a quiet office setting.I really wanted to stick with this keyboard for its excellent ergonomics, but the key response was a deal breaker.

This will keep your coworkers from throwing you, and the keyboard out the nearest window...CAREFULLY pry off the space bar, you will find two identical sets of paired posts with holes on each side of the space where the key was, the bottom hole is where the guide pin goes, the top is just for stability of the space bar when you press it down. THIS is the post you need to focus on, grab a very thin piece of rubber (about 1mm thick) and cut a small circle just enough to cover the whole and glue it on top to act as a damper. The space bar is the only key on the board that makes a definite tapping sound when you press it. All the other keys are dampened enough by the membrane underneath. Do this small thing and you will have a very quiet keyboard and happy coworkers.

(Since the USB connector on these is male, and the USB connector on the MS 4000 keyboard is male, you have to use a F-F gender changer between them). These sell for about $50-150.00.(4) Praying(5) Holding my breath and contorting my mouth into unusual shapes,none of which worked.I cannot understand WHY it is not possible to get this keyboard to work through USB-to-PS2 converters.  I posted questions in a few online forums about this, but have never gotten any answers.Since then, I have discovered that there are also a few USB mouses (both wired and wireless) made by Microsoft, which similarly do not work with the KVMs, converters/adapters, splitters/emulators.

What are we gaining from this difference?Microsoft won't answer this question.

You can type while talking on the phone and the person you're talking too won't hear it. The layout is amazingly intuitive. I'd even say perfect. It's just so easy to use. I use mine every day and have yet to feel any discomfort.What would make this keyboard perfect? Back-lit keys and if the zoom thing in the middle was a scroll for web browsing. None of the back-lit keyboards are anywhere near as comfortable and I have yet to see any keyboard with a scroll control in the middle so this is still my all time favorite keyboard. If the keyboard was wireless and had a mini trackball like on server rack style keboards, I'd probably use the keyboard while lying down in bed and hook up a large screen TV as the monitor. The keyboard is also very comfortable in your lap.I especially love the parentheses ( ) above the keypad. Makes typing my phone number so much easier. The layout of all the keys really is the best I have seen on any keyboard by any manufacturer. I also find myself using the ""back"" button under the space bar while web surfing. Saves me the trouble of having to reach for the mouse or the ""backspace"" key.Considering how often Microsoft likes to change up the key layout, particularly with the insert and delete keys, I would suggest buying two. I think that they got it right is a fluke that they will probably undo in next years model.",1169596800

I have been using this keyboard for over 8 years now and I continue to be happy with the results.  I am a programmer and type all day long.  My wrists started hurting years ago and surgery became a consideration.  By switching to this keyboard and using a mouse pad with a wrist support I have been able to avoid surgery and do my work without pain.  The result is an improvement in my life due to changing to this ergonomic keyboard.The tilt and angles, including the split takes a bit of time to adapt to, but once done it's very easy to use and does feel natural.  There's a raised front edge piece but due to the height I like to keep my desk at I take that off and use the keyboard in a more level posture.  On Win7 and the newer you don't need any special software, in fact it no longer comes with any, support is built into the OS now.  While there a programmable keys for misc features, I don't use any of that and actually would prefer that they were removed and that the keyboard was smaller.I get a few years out of each keyboard and do my best to keep them clean and dry, water doesn't do nice things for anything plugged into power ;-)  After enough time the keys get a polished look and then the printed text on the keys starts to wear off, but I'm a touch typer anyways so that hasn't been an issue, enough of the letters are there to still assure my hands are in the right place.  What rubs off and where on each key depends on your personal hand placements.I pair my keyboard up with the Belkin Waverest Gel Mouse Pad and am happy with the results and looks on my desk.5 stars, great design that last years and helps with wrist pain.

"02 12, 2007","[3, 3]",4.0,One more positive review,B000A6PPOK,Ed,A2BMZRO0H7TFCS,"Next to my Kinesis Ergo keyboard, this is the nicest ergo keyboard I've ever used and at just a fraction of the cost.For anyone who spends a lot of time on their computer, ergonomics is a very important consideration when making hardware purchases.  Split key design seems to be the first thing an ergo keyboard should have, but the rest of the design is probably just preferece.  My Kinesis has concaved keys, which is hard to describe, but just imagine putting the keys inside two cereal bowls set apart by a few inches.  This promotes better alignment of your wrists so that they don't need to bend upwards.  The split prevents your wrists from bending sideways.  The MS Natural Ergo KB 4000 finally adds the feature of keeping your wrists from bending up by providing a removeable reverse slope attachment.  Some people may not like this but for me, it's a must.  Also keep in mind that with the reverse slope attachment, your keyboard may not fit under your desk if you're using a keyboard tray.  Mine doesn't.The keys feel so great when you type and make very little noise.  The wrist rest material feels very smooth and cushy, unlike a lot of cheap plastic wrist rest attachments that some keyboards come with.  I like having a lot of extra buttons on the keyboard so that I don't have to use my mouse as much.  The mouse is the worst ergonomic invention ever.  It has ruined many a wrists.  I have 2 MS Digital Media Pro keyboards that I love as well and wish that the Ergo 4000 had two additional keys that my old KB had.  The Log Off and Sleep buttons were great as I could shut down my machine or switch user without having to use the mouse and click on confirm buttons.  I also wish you could reprogram the zoom button to be a scroll button.All in all, this is a one fantastic keyboard.  My only small complaint is the lack of some buttons that I liked on their old keyboards.  Also, you should feel very comfortable buying hardware from Microsoft.  I've only ever had to call Microsoft hardware support twice in my life and both times they sent me replacements for my defective/broken items (one mouse and one keyboard) without hassle.",1171238400

Pun ""Neji""",A353UMICWSJPAG,"Biased opinion starts Now:As a gamer, I needed an upgrade from the regular Dell keyboard I had been using for a few years.  I was hesitant on buying this keyboard after reading many many Amazon reviews.  Apparently people had a problem with the space bar being stiff.  MY spacebar works fine, it just feels like a big version of the other keys so +1 to soft, quiet working spacebar.  The other keys are not loud as well so this is a plus. Pressing them is softer than most and can be compared with the Saitek Eclipse II and can even outmatch it in terms of ergonomics. Also, I do not type for a living.  I mostly chat with a mic.  The reason I bought this keyboard is because I saw it at Best Buy and after resting my hands on it, I felt at ease.  It is the most comfortable keyboard I have ever encountered.A couple of my gamer friends recommended some gaming keyboards and I tried them, but they did not leave an impression or desire as this one did at Best Buy.  Among the recommended keyboards are the super popular Saitek Eclipse II, and F4t4lity, both which I believe are inferior in terms of typing, comfort, and gaming.  Multiplayer FPS games are getting very popular and the WASD keys used for moving are Very important, and with comfortability comes ease of use.Try it at Best Buy if you are not sure.  Amazon had* a good price($25-$35) and eBay does as well of course.The keyboard works EVEN WITHOUT INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE(I'm using XP Pro), I am typing this entire passage without inserting the CD once.  The CD is used for the programmable favorites keys at the top as well as the alternative keys for the F(function) keys and maybe some other functions that don't matter to me. Out of the box, the Homepage key works, the volume keys work, the calculator key works as well as the standard keys.  Do not install the software if you do not need it, I definitely do not.I do not have my fingers on the 8 home keys as pro typers do, I just use what fingers I am used to.  You can get used to the split in less than a week. Since I do not type too much, I also do not have to get re-used to regular keyboards at my school either.This keyboard is the best I've seen even for casual typers.Either try it or buy it now, Trust me.",1226620800

If that's the only thing you're looking for then stop reading right now and buy this thing; the leather-ish palm rest is great and never looked worn or dirty. The keys are soft and not overly loud.I'm giving it only two stars because of the many flaws I found while it worked:1. Keys fade quickly. In about 2 or 3 months tops, the imprint on the most frequently used keys will disappear completely. This is normally a non-issue for experienced typists, but since I work with Unix consoles most of the time, remembering where the pipe or the backlash is was infuriating. Not to mention the fact that it should not happen on a ""premium"" product.2. Space bar gets stuck. This happened mostly when the keyboard was new. After about a month or so the key loosened a bit and rarely got stuck again, but probably my fingers started remembering where to press on it to avoid that too. Sometimes it still got stiff as if the spring went bad.3. Two drops of liquid were enough to kill it. Obviously you should not get a keyboard near any liquids, but everybody do it all the time and usually they can handle a bit of moisture. Well, not this one. I took it apart to see why it stopped working and I was surprised to see that the plastic ""floor"" under the keys is not a single piece, but actually has lots of cracks and holes by design, and they give direct access to the electronics to anything you may throw in there by accident.I'm now using the excellent Fellowes antibacterial ergonomic keyboard, and while it's not as full-featured as the MS Ergo 4000, I can tell already is a better quality product designed to last.",1296518400

I'm a business systems programmer and after a few years of crunching away on the keyboards that get thrown in with the computer, my fingers started to get some telltale aches.  This keyboard certainly did a good job of alleviating those aches - between the natural wrist and key angles and the soft, pliant action of the keys, the Ergo 4000 is a really comfortable keyboard to type on.  It was the finger equivalent going from a stiff high school desk chair to a Lay-Z-Boy.  You notice immediately that the (semi-satisfying) snap and sharp action of standard keyboard keys is replaced with a near-silent, soft feel.  The wrist support is also surprisingly comfortable, lined with some kind of soft rubber.  It might be different if you're used to a standard keyboard, but your fingers will thank you.  I also found the range of application and document launching shortcuts that line of the top of the keyboard quite handy, saving a little bit of mouse work.I must say that after a year and a half of good service, my original Ergo became useless when a single letter stopped working.  Prior to that (and on the replacement keyboard I bought), there hadn't any hint of a mechanical problem - every key working as smoothly as the day I bought it.  Minor mechanical problems on sub-$100 items aren't out of the question, but I thought I'd mention it in case your read of other problems.

Sure I could have used S-Spline graphics software to enhance the relatively tine fully sized image, but I expect a full sized, especially natural keyboard, to sport TWO Windows Flag keys.  WinFlag+L is a common right handed only stroke.If there were an easy, as in ZERO bloatware, solution to reassign the USELESS AFAIK context menu button that sits where the WinFlag key was on my last keyboard I will be happy.It does not amuse me to install bloatware to be able to use the scroll wheel in windows [on the Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 I bought in combination with this Microsoft Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000].  The microsoft native driver does not offer this feature.  HOWEVER the native drivers picked for my Razer DiamondBack InfraRed Laser mouse has ALL buttons working out-of-the-box in XP.I realize the Razer DiamondBack is ORDERS of magnitude superior to this mouse -- this mouse is not a replacement for any Razer mouse, but native windows support for the Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 is SEVERELY LACKING.I highly recommend the Razer DiamondBack InfraRed Laser mouseI do not recommend the Microsoft Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000 if you rely on a right side Windows FLAG key like I do.  If that is not an issue, and you require neither key tap resistance, nor key tap click feedback then you will be happy with this natural keyboard -- the additional 'curve' of the keys offered no challenge to me already familiar with microsoft natural keyboards,  I appreciate the 'front loaded' height of the keyboard, but the padding leaves much to be desired.  One can feel pad flex with considerable applied pressure but if you're looking for a cushy wrist- or palm rest please consider buying an additional pad.  As I was not comfortable also raising the keyboard from the bottom/back stands look elsewhere for a review on that.The LEDs on the keyboard for CAPS, NumLock, Scroll Lock, and Function lock are not trillion lux very much unlike the mere scroll wheel on my Razer mouse.  A thin strip of electrical tape can easily be applied if the are too bothersome as there is only one sloped surface with which to contend.The keyboard was ""built with windows 7 (aka vista) in mind"".  When the next windows is NOT built with hollywood fascism in mind I might consider it if I have not already abandoned microsoft for apple -- the latter will easily run XP in VM.I have no problems switch hitting between a microsoft natural keyboard and a straight key layout keyboard.  I eventually plan to add DVORAK layout keys to this keyboard.* If you are aware of a LIGHT weight utility to change the context key to a win FLAG key please leave me a comment.  I prefer my utilities not store anything in registry and keep all its associated files in the same of sub-directory of the executable itself.

"08 11, 2008","[3, 3]",5.0,Best keyboard I've ever used,B000A6PPOK,"Gary Bisaga ""Christian Father and Husband""",A3SJD66YQAF265,"A few months ago, I was having problems with my left hand after using the computer keyboard all day and playing guitar at night. Namely, my fingers went numb in five minutes of playing! Mild carpal tunnel syndrome is the cause; not severe enough for treatment, but bad enough to make my fingers go numb.Rather than quitting playing guitar, I decided to start by replacing my keyboard with a MS Natural Ergo Keyboard. And it has made all the difference in the world. Since I started using the keyboard, I have only had finger numbness once, and that was after prolonged driving rather than typing. I think it safe to say that this keyboard has completely solved my symptoms, without forcing me to quit music.It has a nice comfortable built-in wrist rest, covered with comfortable leatherette. You can raise the front or the back of the keyboard with the supplied support, but I recommend raising the back (side closest to your belly). Between the support at the back, the downward angle between halves of the split keyboard, the outward cant of the keys, and the curved ""gull wing"" key positions, you will find your hands are held at totally natural and comfortable angles that totally avoid wrist stress. Since this is why most of us buy the keyboard, it does this job extremely well.The keyboard itself is well thought-out, with keys to do every function you could ever want. The row of F keys across the top are dual-function like earlier models, but unlike earlier models the ""F lock"" now stays on between restarts. So, once you make the keys map to their standard F-key mapping, the keyboard remembers that setting. USUALLY. Occasionally the F-lock setting will reset: you know because you'll hit F-keys and the applications will start complaining that they don't recognize the command you're typing. To help with recognition of this situation, the ""locked"" lights are right down between your thumbs: Caps lock, scroll lock, num lock, and F lock.It also has two interesting features between the halves of the keyboard: back/forward buttons and a ""Zoom"" slider. The back/forward buttons, which you click with your thumbs, work great for web page navigation, although I find sometimes the ""back"" button goes back more than one web page. The zoom slider, on the other hand, is totally worthless. It is inconsistently supported by applications, and not really very useful to start out with. Fortunately, the keyboard is fully programmable, and a little searching (google for Josh Highland's blog entry called ""hacking the Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000"") discovered a handy script you can install to convert the useless ""zoom"" slider into a highly functional ""scroll"" slider. I love it. Now you don't have to keep going back to the mouse to scroll up and down pages.There are also programmable keys at the top, including calculator, play/pause, no speaker, and ""My favorites."" I have not used many of these, but thankfully the web-oriented ones respect your default browser so you can use firefox instead of IE. They might be handy for some people.One caution: when you plug it in, you will wonder how you will ever learn to type on it. You'll be convinced that somebody has applied a security device that keeps you from doing any work. Don't worry, you'll learn. The first day I had serious productivity problems; by the second working day, I was fine with it. I should note that if you are a fast typist but not a touch typist, you probably will have some problems. The only lingering problems I have are bad habits I had picked up over 30 years of programming such as sometimes reaching across to hit the ""Y"" with my left index finger.

I won't lie, it takes some time getting acclimated to the key layout and the fact that Microsoft also split the number and F-keys doesn't make it easier. Luckily the cursor keys and number pad stay familiar. It took me about 2-3 days to get used to the split layout, and it does help you type ""correctly"" as I have grown sloppy over the years with using the wrong finger for the keys. It is a bad habit I developed from years of first-person shooter gaming where I'd use a mouse and keyboard together.The shortcut keys are a big help, and once Windows 7 detected my new keyboard, it automatically installed Microsoft Intellipoint Type which produces an on-screen display for the volume adjustments. This OSD pops up whenever you use the volume adjustment shortcut keys on the keyboard. The Web/Home and Search keys work properly, but the Mail shortcut key directed me to Outlook by default even though my default mail program was Mozilla Thunderbird. I had to manually reset the shortcut key to Thunderbird via the Intellipoint software.The integrated zoom feature is awesome but only works if you have the Intellipoint software installed. I use the keyboard at work where the drivers are not permitted, but when I evaluated the zoom feature at home it worked like a charm. The back and forward keys work fine without the driver, as does the calculator shortcut key. The coolest feature of this keyboard is the soft integrated palmrest. It feels like a thin foam padded wrest but it has a nice synthetic cover. It is extremely comfortable to use.Overall: 5/5 stars, some time is required to acclimate to the split layout, and I still find myself mistyping words after over a week of use.

That seems to have changed recently.I bought this keyboard in October 2007 and within a month noticed that the letters on the frequently used keys were either gone or wearing off. I suspect it's because instead of the older (and more expensive) method of injection molding the symbols on the keys which makes them a permanent part of the key, they are now using the much cheaper method of using something like decals which is only a surface treatment and so rub off fairly quickly.This seems to be a trend with all Microsoft hardware. Used to be they were always of high quality and durability, now-a-days they just seem cheap except for the prices they charge. This keyboard is just one example, another example is the Intellimouse Explorer 4.0 vs. the 3.0 version. I had a single 3.0 version for years and it always worked, but with the 4.0 version I have to replace it about every six months because the buttons start to fail.Next time I need to replace my keyboard and/or mouse, I'll most likely not even look at Microsoft products.",1213488000

Sadly, this was not the case.The keyboard has a few fatal flaws for people with RSI. The first, and least serious of them, is the difficulty in pressing some keys (the chief culprit here is the Space bar). A few keys require an inordinate amount of pressure to properly depress.The second flaw is the size of the right-hand set of keys. They take up a large amount of your desk real estate which, in turn, means that reaching over to the mouse (or trackball in my case) requires more of an effort than with a regular keyboard. This puts more stress on the wrist, which is the exact opposite of what you would want in an ergonomic keyboard.Finally, the ""F-lock"" feature really bothers me. This ""feature"" means that the function keys (F1 through F12) are not enabled until you press the F-lock key. And you have to press it during every user session (e.g. every reboot, every wake from sleep or hibernation) in order for the function keys to be enabled. Very aggravating.The programmability of the keyboard is a nice feature but, of course, was not one of the critical features I was looking for in an ergonomic keyboard.

Also, the space bar was particularly noisy when fully depressed.  Second, the ergonomic design of the keyboard was quite pleasant, but the spacing and the sizing of the keys (some letter keys are larger than others) made typing a bit difficult; larger hands may find it a bit easier going.  Finally, the web quick access button did not permit programming any other browser to open other than Microsoft's Internet Explorer, even bypassing the default browser (FireFox) set up on my computer.

I picked one up and WITHIN DAYS the pain had subsided and continued to subside until it completely went away.Occasionally I had to type on a standard keyboard (different computer) and I could actually FEEL the difference in my wrists! The Ergonomic Keyboard makes THAT big of a difference!I sit at a computer all day for about 8-10 hours and this thing has been a life-saver! I finally wore my old one out (well, ok, I spilled a water bottle on it & killed it) so I quickly bought another (Thank You Amazon!).I'm typing on the new one as I speak and am still loving how well it feels on my wrists (even for the few days I was without one, I really missed it!).NOTE:For those with aching shoulders & wrists, LEAVE THE ELEVATED FRONT ON THE KEYBOARD!!!I've found that if you leave it on and don't raise the back of the keyboard, it's more comfortable on the wrists and puts my wrists in a better ""no pain"" position.Some people hate that I have it when they try to use my computer (they can't seem to figure it out), but hey, all the better for me! Less people messing with my computer! BONUS!!I absolutely love this thing as evidenced by how quickly I bought another one when I killed my original. (For those out there that say, ""well, why didn't you just dry it out?""--well, it was a BIG spill and I tried that; no go. I fried it. It was my fault though, and the keyboard had already given me several years of service though so I didn't mind buying another one).I don't use the extra gray buttons across the top much, but they do work. Even without the software installed (I'm on XP with all the service packs installed). The scroll thing in the center won't work w/o the driver installed, but I never use it anyway so it isn't a big deal (I've used the keyboard with & without the software drivers installed).It didn't take too long to get used to initially (maybe a week tops?) and I can type just as fast as I can on a normal keyboard (80-90 WPM). I did notice that the letters wore off the ""home keys"" on mine fairly quickly, but then, I do type a lot and I wear those down on pretty much any keyboard I've used, so it didn't bother me.If you're debating on getting one or not and if it's to make typing more comfortable for your wrists & arms, go for it.

I used it to replace a Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard. The wrist/palm rests feel very nice, and I like the fact that the keys are quiet - I'm trying to train myself to take notes while on the phone using the computer instead of using a pad of paper, and I find that loud typing while I'm talking on the phone can interfere with my hearing the other person, and with their perception of my attention. The software does seem relatively Spartan but to be honest I'm not a big user of customization features, so it doesn't impact my use of the device. In the past, I haven't even bothered to install keyboard driver software. The zoom feature works nicely in Firefox, I don't use IE much.So, for my use - standard typing for many hours/day, minimal use of special features - it's a great keyboard. I'm glad it's got the older-style cursor key/insert-delete-scroll key setup, rather than the setup used on the Natural Elite, that I never did really become accustomed to.Chances are pretty good I'll buy another one to use at home this weekend - I am really happy with this, enough so that I'm ready to give up the old ergo keyboard I've got at home that doesn't have the negative tilt but does have the arrow-key configuration that I prefer.I realize that split keyboards are interesting to a minority of the population (and everyone should use what works best for them) - but if you're one of the split keyboard people, I suggest giving this one a try.",1130457600

I don't mind a little noise, personally, and I can't imagine anyone around you being distracted or annoyed by the relatively minor clicking.However, if you buy this keyboard, BEWARE THE 'FUNCTION LOCK' BUTTON, which might quite possibly be the dumbest idea ever. Let me explain with an example:You're using Excel, but unbeknownst to you the 'function lock' key is enabled, which is similar to locking down the shift key. However, unlike caps lock (which locks down the shift key as well), you can't tell the 'shift' key is actually locked down because the letters you type appear as lower case. However, when you go to edit a cell and press F2, your most recent edit disappears. WHY? Because the function lock key treats a press of F2 like you pressed both SHIFT+F2.>> Shift+F2 is the 'undo' button...and you have no idea what's happening if you accidentally pressed the 'function lock' key as I did.Annoying? Absolutely. So annoying that I damn near broke this thing in frustration trying to figure out what the hell was wrong.So, good keyboard...but when you take it out of the box, grab a small screwdriver and pop that function lock key right off the board (it's just above the backspace key).

By day I'm a software developer, by night an instructor at a local university.  I am typing for writing code, and typing my lecture notes, tests, slides, and feedback to students.  I basically live at a keyboard.  I have had previous Microsoft ergonomic keyboards, but this one is by far my favorite for a couple of different reasons.  The primary is that I can type pain free for long periods of time.While I have one of these keyboards on my desktop at home, and one at work, I don't have one hooked up to my laptop, which is usually sitting on the couch.  It is when I'm using my laptop that I notice the benefits of this keyboard.  After typing on the laptop keyboard for 30-45 minutes, my wrists begin to hurt, and it's generally just not comfortable to type anymore.  Using this keyboard, I can type for hours at a time in complete comfort.As for the setup, I have the riser on the front and the feet dropped in the back.  This is opposite what many (or most) people do with their keyboards.  I find that the setup allow me to properly use the wrist rest and keeps the keys in a neutral position, allowing me to type quickly and comfortably.When I first got this keyboard, the setup seemed like the best choice, though the first 3-4 days of using it, I just couldn't get comfortable, then suddenly something snapped (figuratively), and it all the sudden felt extremely comfortable, and natural.  For those of you who buy this and are thinking about returning it after a couple days, give it a week or more to actually try it out.There are a few thing I don't like about this keyboard, but none of them take off anything from my review, because this is a keyboard.  The primary functions work perfectly.  That being said, the list of things I don't like: The zoom button (never use it, no need), the back/forward buttons, the media buttons (web/home, search, mail, and the macro buttons), never get used.  That being said, Play, volume and mute are often used, and I love them.  The calculator button is also a big win in my book.How do I know this keyboard is a win?  While work provides us with ergonomic keyboards, they are often not very good ones, which is why I originally bought this one.  After a couple of weeks of use, 3 of my coworkers bought their own, now, 2/3 of the department uses them.A couple final thoughts.  I have been using this keyboard for 4 years now, and haven't had a reason to consider anything else.  The number are still printed on the keys, I've dropped enough food in it to feed a small cat, and it still functions, I've spilled water on it and it still works (and cleaned out most of the food).A keyboard (along with a mouse) are how we interface with a computer, and if that is comfortable, you won't do it.

However, after about a week of usage, it loosen and you're able to type at normal speed without consciously pushing the space bar down harder.All in all it's great keyboard for typing, and it helped with my wrist pain. I'd recommend this keyboard for anyone that is having a wrist problem, or need a great ergonomic keyboard.",1278460800

Fuchs ""jax76""",A3H7ADUP07D93H,"I got this keyboard for my office but still use the older Natural Keyboard Elite at home. The older keyboard is much more comfortable and responsive and I really wish Microsoft would bring it back.This keyboard, while more attractive than the older model, is much harder to use. The keys are a lot stiffer and control key commands are slow. On the Elite, you can pretty much press the control key and the alphabetic key at the same time. On this keyboard, you have to hold down the control key a brief moment before you press the other key. If you don't, unexpected errors occur - for instance if, when copying text, you hit the ""C"" key too quickly, it deletes the text and won't paste it when you hit ctrl-V.The function keys can be used for internet scrolling, but since I primarily use my mouse for that, I just find that all the extra keys and functions clutter up the keypad. Plus, the letters are harder to see on a black background, although on the plus side, it doesn't get as dirty as the cream-colored Elite. And while, in theory the strip at the bottom of the keyboard ought to be more comfortable because of the padding, it isn't.I could live with all the other issues if it weren't for the stiffness of the keys and the sluggishness of the response when using ctrl commands.  I'll take the comfort of an ergonomic keyboard over a standard keyboard any day, but it's almost worth paying the exorbitant fees to find an older model just because of how much easier the actual typing is.This keyboard just goes to show that keyboards are, perhaps, like women - just because one is younger and pretty than another doesn't mean it's better.",1359072000

"05 2, 2012","[0, 0]",5.0,Still the best keyboard I've ever owned.,B000A6PPOK,JGalarza,A3MZA7HNI6FQCQ,"This is my second Ergo 4000 and I really couldn't be happier (well if it was wireless that would be sooooo awesomer).  I bought my first one after 4 months of being a software engineer.  I wrote code for about 8 hours a day (9-5, m-f) so my wrist started to hurt after a whole day of typing.  I bought one of those keyboard cushions and hated it.  I found this keyboard for sale on, I think, Newegg and have been loving it ever since.  That keyboard is still working just fine but needs to be taken apart and cleaned (all keyboards need to be cleaned, ew).  I decided to buy a new one and take the old one home for use in my 'home office'.  I have spent hours and hours trying to find a replacement that I would like.  Saddly split ergos are not in fashion any more.  I've tried the Wave and played with a bunch of logitech keyboards but the only one I've even thought about switching to is theSmartfish Technologies K2418B Reflex ErgoMotion Keyboardbut after finding a YouTube videos and seeing how loud it is when it moves turned me off completely.  That and people complained about the cramped numberpad which I use a lot.  I even tried looking for a split that at least had some kind od padding like the 4000 but all I found was either gel or plastic.  I ended up coming right back to this one.  It may not be stylish as a logitech, or as solid as a 80's mechanical keyboard but this thing still beats them all at comfort and reliablity.Actual Review:The keys are pretty silent but I type kind of fast and hard so there is some muted clacking but it's pretty light.  The keys themselves have a matted feel to them and spring back up when you press down.  You don't need a lot of force to press but you know you pressed a key.  Rarely can you accidently press a key and not know you did (never happened to me but I guess these things can happen).There are reviews about the how you have to press near the center of the spacebar to register a ""space"" but I've never had that.  The spacebar is oversized and my thumbs rest directly on it without any effort on my part.  Some split keys boards have the two spacebars or the oddly shaped one but this board has an oversized one that spands the entire split.I've never set up the ""My Favorites"" keys so I can't comment on those but I saw somewhere online that you could substitute macros rather than *.exe or homepages.  (If I find it again I'll edit this post.)The Zoom button I use rarely but only when I need to up the font size in Notepad++.I use the hell out of the volume and calculator buttons.  The play button works in iTunes but is really meant for Windows Media Player.  The volume controls are meant for the system sound not as a media player control.My programming enviroments do not recognize the ""=""/""(""/"")"" keys found above the numberpad but this is due mainly to such old software (VS6) but Word (even 2010) sees them.Cons:The only real complaint I have is that there is no real wireless version.  The 7000 I think is wireless but you need to use the mouse and I have no need for it (I use a Logitech VX at home and a MX at work).And just a note, depending on what OS and hardware you are on the volume controls can take up to a 3-4 seconds to adjust the volume.  I'm pretty sure on a fast system that you won't even notice a lag if there is one.Remarks:After 5 years of solid use the key that were oringally matte are now shiny and a few letters have rubbed off but the keyboard still works just as it did the day I first set it up.  It's been to 3 different companies and survived 2 moves.  The pleather/leather is still the same color as it was, no rips, no fading, no tearing apart, no little pieces flaking off, etc.  A rubber foot did come off but that happened like a few months ago which agains speaks volumes about the overall construction.  And the little led lights on the bottom still work!I'll post a picture of them side by side later so you can see what I'm talking about.",1335916800

I have always used MS keyboards and mice. My last keyboard was the Natural Keyboard Pro (NP). I think that the Ergonomic 4000 (4000) is an overall improvement on the NP. Yes, the spacebar sticks a little - but it is slowly working itself out and like everything else in life, you get used to it in the meantime - I almost didn't purchase the 4000 because of other reviewers cries concerning the spacebar. I took the term a little too literally - the action of the spacebar is different - it doesn't literally stick and keep entering spaces - it just takes a little more pressure to press it, which, like I said, is changing with use and I don't even think about it anymore. Installation was easy. The first thing I noticed about the 4000 was the solid feel as compared to the NP - I can't think of another way to describe it - the NP was a great keyboard but after using the 4000 I was struck by the difference in feel. The NP made more noise - as though it were more hollow and clunky - than the 4000.I do miss some of the keys that were present on the NP but are not present on the 4000, not the least of which is the ""My Computer"" key. Yes, there are 5 programmable keys but in their effort to make the 4000 user-friendly (IMHO), MS has removed some of the programmability from these keys - basically, all you can do is point the key to a program or shortcut - and you have to do this without benefit of a list like the one available with the NP. This is not a big deal for me but others might find it more difficult to locate the programs or shortcuts they wish to use (please understand that this is actually easy to do - just not what I am used to). I can remember a time when one could use a pre-loaded list or set up a custom command using switches and optional parameters. Now, I suppose the only way to do that is to create a shortcut and alter the command in the shortcuts' properties dialog. It just seems kind of round about. The other keys I miss are the keys for controlling the Windows Media Player. It does have a play/pause button and volume control and mute but I miss the next and previous track buttons and the stop button - although this is a minor problem since each of those functions has an equivalent keyboard shortcut - it's just difference between pressing two keys or one.As for the zoom button - I thought this was a pretty useless button until I realized that it wasn't the buttons' fault. One of the (if not THE) uses of this button is to increase font size on a web page. The problem is that Internet Explorer does a REALLY crappy job of this - at least in IE6. Perhaps IE7 does a better job - on par with Firefox and Opera. Anyway, the button does work and it saves you the trouble of having to move the + and - keys on the numeric keypad.The function keys are dual purpose. I haven't really used them for anything but function keys. There is a function lock key which locks them in the function key mode. When unlocked, they perform the following operations: Help, Undo, Redo, New, Open, Close, Reply, Fwd, Send, Spell, Save, Print. I have not tested them.I really like this keyboard. It is a good, solid keyboard and an overall improvement on its predeccessor. The padded palm rest is very comfortable. I would highly recommend it - as would my father who also loves his.",1213574400

Granted, as with anything new, you'll need some time to familiarize yourself with it, before things start to really sync up.

Pombrio,ACISLJANCZZ6L,"The Ergo keyboard 4000 is a really terrific keyboard has three significant benefits over my last favorite keyboard, the MS Natural keyboard Pro.The first is the terrific riser in the front, creating a negative tilt. To create this tilt on the Pro, I had to elevate my wrists by using a piece of 2 by 4 cut to match the keyboard and then equipped with a wrist rest. The new Ergo has both the height and the rest set up perfectly. Note that if you have your keyboard set on a table or tray that is too high, this would be awkward. When the keyboard is set up properly (forearms  parallel to the floor  see site [...] ), the Ergo is extremely kind to your wrists and the best I have EVER used. The lift can be removed but please try to use it, the negative tilt is a terrific ergo device.The second improvement is that the keys are much better. They take to edge hits much better than the old keyboard. There are also a lot less noisy than the Pro. (There is indeed a dead spot on the extreme  upper corners of the space bar but I have NEVER noticed it- I have to contort my thumbs just to hit the spacebar like that and is a very unnatural).The third improvement is the wealth of special keys, especially the favorites key and the F lock and num lock keys that remembers their settings. The favorites can start a program that you choose while the other silver keys can do commands (like copy, paste, and exit). The back/forward buttons I find pretty much useless as I have these set up on my mouse. The zoom key is used to change text size which works well for my old trifocal eyes.Negatives?

Petric ""Overtkill""",A2ZDX2GRH96GL5,"This is the best designed keyboard by Micro$oft since Natural Internet keyboard. For a time after they did away with that design, all they had available was the Natural Keyboard Elite, which totally sucks. The other complaint in their designs was the redesigned placement of the Insert/Home/Pgup/PgDwn area, where the keys were designed in a vertical arrangement. Not to mention the arrow keys were often placed in a cross pattern, instead of the standard old school inverted T. Having worked for Microsoft in the past, I can tell you that sometimes people there over-think things to the point that they think they can reinvent the wheel! I'm sure many of you who work in a corporate environment are familiar with these people. :)Anyway -This beautifully designed keyboard appeared on the market a couple of years ago! I've loved most everything about this ting since day one. The keys are the soft, easy, and smooth depression type, the re-designed curvature of the key layout of the major keys is quite an improvement! And feel infinitely better on my hands and fingers. I am also somewhat picky about the looks as well and MS did not disappoint here either. Its sexy black with silver programmable and function keys at the top rock! And they restored the aforementioned insert/home keys to normal placement! Wonderful!The only improvement they could make IMHO would be to drop the F Lock function all together. This function turns the F1 through F12 keys into Office functions. Anyone who seriously uses their or anyone's office suites, should already know these functions by use of regular hot keys. Though don't fret this all together, at least the F Lock key is off by default, making it less annoying. In short, I view this as a worthless function to their keyboards.I run a small IT/Consulting (sometimes insulting)/Systems Administration company. I have sold these to clients who prefer the natural design and have heard nothing but rave reviews from them.For those thinking of making the leap from a standard design keyboard to a natural, I offer this advice... The biggest thing you will have problems with at first is the adjusted reach to keys, because they are positioned differently. If you are serious, give yourself some time getting used to this design. Some do make the trtansition rather quickly, and some folks never do like it. Its well worth the old collage try to see if you can make the leap. :)Note on price: This Keyboard can be found around $25.00 - 30.00 range. So shop around!Lastly, thanks for reading! :)",1259107200

To be honest, I'd never really thought about the ergonomic aspect before.My initial thoughts were that this keyboard seems very well made and sturdy. There is nothing about it that feels cheap - the plastic feels tough, the wrist rest feels soft but durable and they keys have an excellent travel and feel to them. I really appreciate the damped sound compared to my Saitek.Next, I am impressed with the range of extra buttons on this keyboard - I never thought I'd use them, but I do. It actually is handy to have my browser, email, search and calculator right there. The zoom slider seems a little pointless, but horses for courses!But what has impressed me most of all is the ergonomic design. They have obviously given a tremendous amount of thought and research into laying out these keys - and what a result! Never before have my hands felt like they were in such a natural position. Going back to my Saitek briefly I can't believe that I typed in that position for so long - it's no wonder I'd started to get pains in my wrists and forearms. This keyboard is comfortable with a capital ""C"". I really like the raised wrist position. It took me maybe an hour to get used to the angled key layout and I love it now.

But there's a clever hack(customization) where you can convert it to a scroll function. Micro peeps should configure this by default (Scroll way more useful than zoom).Big ass body : The whole point of this keyboard is for the ergonomics and good posture. Because the keyboard is like a spaceship(but cool looking), if you have just one table or platform for your keyboard and mouse, you necessarily have to keep your mouse at a distance, which isn't ideal from an ergonomic point of view(but not too much of a biggie).goes without saying you can use this keyboard comfortable only if you know how to touchtype :P !+ve:You will learn to touchtype: As a corollary to my last negative, You will learn to touchtype with this keyboard. You need to learn to touchtype if you spend more than 2 hours in front of a computer these days.Ergo: The shape of the keyboard and placement of keys (other than spacebar), is pretty darn comfortableKeyboard noise/response: Doesn't make too much noise which is good(but neither does it feel rock solid. This keyboard will serve a furious typer for about 4 years).Billions of useful hotkeys: You don't need all of them, but there are plenty of options, and if you start to get lazy there's a key for everything or a key you can customize to get anything done.--While i don't mind this keyboard, the hard keys are frustrating. After this keyboard conks out on me, i'm going to explore alternatives. Currently  though, I don't see a better option in the market.",1262995200

Brooks,A3HDJ1REEQ1YNP,"This keyboard is comfortable to use once you get used to it, my fingers find the home keys naturally after using it for a week or so. I removed the plastic frame in the front that put the keyboard at an unnatural angle, but if I were using a keyboard tray it would probably work better with it.  The reason for giving it only 3 stars has to do with the orientation of the number keys on top.  (Not the keyboard on the right.)  I was a statistical typist for many years on both electric typewriters and computers before the advent of the separate number keys evolved.  Consequently, I never use the number pad.When Microsoft developed this keyboard, which was probably done by younger people who grew up learning to use the number pad, they divided the numbers incorrectly.  The number 6 should be on the top left side of the right hand but they have placed it on the top right of the left side next to the 5 and the right hand number keys start with the number 7.  This throws off not only my typing of numbers, but also the rest of the symbols over the numbers.  I suppose I will get used to this configuration after a while, but for the moment I find myself making lots of errors on numbers and things like $, @, #, etc.If you can live with this inconvenience, this is an excellent keyboard.  The shortcut keys for favorites, home, mail, volume, etc. are quick and easy to use.  The little extras like the center control to reduce or increase the magnification of the screen make the keyboard a quick way to navigate web pages.",1386720000

I tried cleaning it out but no go so I picked up a few other old ergo boards and none were 'right' this is the 'best' of what I could find available around now.It has an 'odd' shape as you can see from the pictures included in the product description.  It took some time to adjust to this from the old style ergo boards.  It has a rubber 'mat' at the bottom that for me does nothing beyond provide a grippy surface, I purchsed a wrist wrapHandstands Wrist Rest 59220, as my prior board was not comfortable and I intended on using it with that or this if it it needed it.  It turned out for me that it was needed, in addition to the rubber mat on this board doing little for my comfort the back and forward keys located under the space bar are too easy for me to hit when typing on this.  With the wrist rest I now have clearance over them though can no longer see the LED's for Num/Scroll/Caps LOCK.I think it was noted in another review the keys are not painted on but stickers, my fear was they'd be cheap stickers and come off, well I was wrong about that.  They are however still cheap in that they wear off from use, perhaps not cutting my fingernails super short?, I've got 2 keys that lost almost half their white lettering after 4 months and a third just starting. My previous keyboards went years before letters started to fade/wear off but not this one.I'll add I'm not a fan of the limited choices in ergo boards, the small enter key, the cross style of arrows or reduced backspace key.  This was the best fit for the layout I wanted that I could find and wasn't priced ridiculously, I don't think I even found an outrageously priced one that was my 'perfect' layout.Finally I'll state the obvious it is black and hard to see if you have low or poor lighting, with my monitors I'm often somewhat 'blinded' to see keys instantly.  Just something to remember when choosing this, white letters are nice but in a field of black they don't stand out that much against a couple of 23"" screens, even worse if the letters start to fade.

And, as the price has gone down on the ""regular"" Natural keyboards, so has the quality. With the 4000, I knew it was a step up, and I very much preferred the faux leather wrist rest over the plastic one on the standard Natural keyboard, so I didn't consider any alternatives.I noticed that the price I got on the 4000 was pretty stellar, and hadn't given it much more thought until the keyboard arrived. Sadly, Microsoft has chosen to make the 4000 flimsier and less responsive than older models. The very first thing I noticed was that the Windows key on the new keyboards has a beveled logo (unlike my old 4000 keyboard, which looks like the one in Amazon's picture). I thought this was to unify their branding with the Vista and Windows 7 logos, but didn't realize that this was now a decent identifier of ""new"" keyboards.The newer 4000's feel really cheap. Key travel isn't remotely as smooth as in the previous generation, and I'd go as far as to say that it isn't as good as a basic Natural keyboard. The mechanisms don't seem to be built for larger keys, so you have to find sweet spots in keys like CTRL and the space bar, or else you're just bending plastic without registering a keystroke.On Windows, not surprisingly, plugging in the keyboard is all you need to do. You can install the Intellitype software, but it doesn't do much beyond adding a few icons throughout the OS and extend macro capability. On OS X, IntelliType is required if you want to swap the CTRL, ALT, and Windows keys to represent CTRL, Option, and Command keys on a standard Mac keyboard. The included software works fine on Snow Leopard and the default action is to swap the keys for you. Unfortunately, the software requires a reboot, and they haven't quite figured out 64-bit control panel objects in OS X.If I had it to do over again, I'd probably go to a bricks-and-mortar store and see if I could score myself an older 4000. Similarly, I'd gladly pay more money to have the quality of the old 4000 back. Microsoft ruined a once-wonderful keyboard (again!) to move more units. Unless you like the look of a black split keyboard over a white one, you might as well save a few bucks more and go with the standard white Natural keyboard.",1264291200

Microsoft never seems to learn that and puts it on the left side of this keyboard.  I even called them up and created an enhancement request for it years ago, but they don't seem to be able to get their thumbs out to do it correctly.The overall keyboard feels smooth and the keys are easier to use than a square keyboard. However, everytime that I need to press the 6 key, I have to relearn where it ""is"" as oppose to where it ""should"" be. If you learn typing correctly, be cognizant that the 6 key is a constant nuissance. Microsoft makes a wavey and contineous ergonomic keyboard that is ""as"" comfortable.Ridiculous as this sounds, if you ever try to press the ""6"" correctly as most typing teachers suggest, you will surely get a strain with your right finger--hence, this definately would NOT be an ergonomic solution.",1129766400

I have average sized hands and I always felt like I had to stretch to reach the number and function keys. Also, occasionally the Function key modifier would get stuck off and the Function keys would no longer work. It was a really stupid feature to overload the function keys with yet another key. Even more stupid is to occasionally lose the user's setting on this key for no reason.

I've been using it now for two weeks and have determined that the problem is due to the curvature of the keyboard. The farther away from the center of the spacebar you that you tap it, the stiffer it is and is thus less responsive. If you happen to tap it closer to the middle, then it's fine.I'm a programmer and I type all day long and use the entire keyboard (function keys and all the puntuation that comes with writing code). After I had a chance to use an ergonomic keyboard for a couple months w/o any pain, I finally purchased the Ergo 4000. I love it.As for a couple specifics, the last ergonomic keyboard I used had an enlarged delete key. The home, end and page keys were normal size. I never got completely used to it and was glad when the Ergo 4000 came with a normal cluster as I use those keys alot.Also, as is typical, this keyboard has a function lock key that can toggle between the standard function keys and special programmed shortcuts. I use the function keys alot and never use the special functions, so I was also pleasently surprised to discover that function lock is turned on by default. So when I first boot up and login, I don't have to remember to turn the function lock on.The only con I can come up with is that there is only a single ""Windows"" shortcut key located on the left side. I also use this key a lot and my last keyboard that came with my Gateway had the shortcut key on both sides and I tend to prefer to have the key on the right side. But I can live with it.

My hands are slender by my fingers are a little longer than average.  I am an excellent touch typist.  My hands are strong and agile but sometimes plagued with repetitive motion pains.I'm a writer an editor, which means that I practically live in front of my keyboard.  The reason I started looking into ergonomic keyboards in the first place was that I was having repetitive motion problems in all of my fingers and other issues with my wrists are arms.  It was getting so bad that I pretty much couldn't type at all.And then I got this keyboard.Cons:-bulkiness.  It will completely fill a normal keyboard tray, leaving no room for the mouse unless you can really squeeze it in (which I do).  But frankly, that's going to happen with any ergonomic keyboard.Pros:- It does what it's supposed to.  I've had the keyboard for about eight months now and can type all day without damaging my fingers.  Even when I've been having repetitive motion problems from my mouse (sigh), I can usually type without pain.  The wrist support is at exactly the right level and the way the keyboard is angled is supremely comfortable.- It lasts (at least, so far).  After eight months, not only does the keyboard still function exactly as it ought to, I had to look closely in full sunlight to spot any wear on the keys.  In those eight months, I have typed well over a hundred thousand words.Other comments:- I've seen some people comment that the space bar is a little harder than on some keyboards.  Of course, to some extent, all external keyboards will have harder space bars than laptops, but it's true that this one took a little adjustment for me.  And by a little, I mean about a week.  Now, I don't notice at all.  The one time it's a problem is when one needs extreme space bar precision.  I place Guild Wars 2, in which there are jumping puzzles, and one must jump -- using the space bar -- at exact and sensitive moments.  For the most difficult of these jumping puzzles, I have to use my laptop space bar instead because I can't be exact enough with this one.",1387152000

The Spacebar is also somewhat problematic in its design: you have to strike it STRAIGHT DOWN, if you tap it at somewhat of an angle, as you are inclined to do due to the shape of the keyboard, as often as not it will not depress fully.I do appreciate that the numberpad and the function keys (Insert, Delete, Home, etc) are in the traditional arrangement.I will agree that the user should be able to customize the functionality of the Zoom scroll in the center of the keyboard... they should be able to fix this in a driver update, should they decide to do so.Overall, its a good keyboard that could be better, and honestly, I think the $65 retail price is a bit steep for what you are getting.

At first, this keyboard was fantastic and it immediately relieved my wrist pain. However, two years later, I have actually gone back to my old Apple Wireless Keyboard because the ergonomic one feels decidedly 'spongy.' In other words, typing doesn't feel crisp, but rather mushy and requires a lot of force to type. It becomes quite fatiguing when writing long essays, or if you have to type for a living, like a software engineer or aspiring writer. You may like it at first, to relieve your pain, but may find yourself going back to 'crisper' keyboards to combat typing fatigue.Sidenote: I've also disassembled and air-pressure canned my keyboard clean, and it still feels mushy.

This would have been the perfect keyboard (natural shape, normal insert/delete/home/end/pgup/pgdown arrows and wheel). On the M$ website, it says that Internet Explorer supports zooming, but it hardly does. It might be a mistake (I think not), but Firefox supports the zoom feature much better than IE but its not listed. Maybe their scared to lose IE clients b/c of people who purchase their keyboard.Getting it set up was pretty dumb. I installed the software, shutdown, swapped keyboards, booted and I couldn't log in. I had to shut down the computer again and boot with both keyboards so Windows would recognize the Microsoft keyboard after it booted up. I wonder what those 4 loading screens do if not load drivers that I just installed. Anyways, I checked Microsoft update to see if there was a critical update or security patch for the keyboard and luckily there wasn't. I actually hoped there would be something to allow us to map zoom to scroll.The keys are also a bit stiff. Especially the spacebar and some of the keys that the right pinky hits.

It's at least 3 inches wider (and a lot bulkier) than my old standard Dell keyboard, not counting the wrist pad or elevating stand. That's a good thing, as it's solid and stays in place, but it also takes up a lot of space. Just from the way it's designed, this isn't the kind of keyboard you can just quickly tap single letters on; you have to put both hands in the correct position or it just feels weird.The keys feel nice and are pretty quiet. You do have to move your fingers quite far for some letters though (y and b are too far from j and f), and the space bar feels a bit squishy. I like that you can create your own shortcuts for each of the top function keys, and the zoom and back/forward buttons are nice to have (though the back/forward buttons are too far down and my mouse already has those).I can see how the key labels can wear off; they're decals, not etched on. The wrist pad feels nice but picks up debris really easily. Also, my stand is lopsided when I have the legs extended. I put a mousepad under one of the legs to compensate, but it still makes a creaking sound at times.All in all, it's a nice keyboard for the money (especially given the limited...or nonexistent...selection at retail stores), if you can get past its issues and take the time to get used to it. I haven't noticed an improvement in my typing speed yet, but with practice...EDIT: 2 months later, I've noticed some wear on the wrist wrests.

"04 21, 2006","[1, 1]",5.0,The most innovative keyboard on the market!!!,B000A6PPOK,"M. R. Simmons ""Techie""",A2DF62DP20RIXF,"I am a relative newcomer to the world of comfort and spilt keyboards. I use a computer for a fair amount of the day; at work, and especially at home. I do a lot of communication online, and I have found that when I use a traditional straight keyboard for a long time, my fingers turn to mush. I can't push the keys right, and my wrists hurt terribly.I decided to invest in a quality keyboard that was designed for comfort and long term use. I looked around, and I found this one. I bought it, and so far, I am very happy with my purchase. There are really alot of selling points that this keyboard has. You can tell that Microsoft had really thought about putting comfort first. For example, this keyboard comes with a built-in (and I mean really BUILT-IN) pad for your wrists. The material that this is made of is really excellent; it provides an excellent amount of comfort without feeling too soft.The keys on this are the best quiet type that I know of. You can barely hear any clicking at all. They also provide good tactile feedback--neither to hard or too soft. My only complaint here is that the spacebar is too hard out of the box. You really have to push it down in order for it to register. I hope that it becomes easier with continued use, but for right now, it is a little too stiff.The keys are designed to slope with the natural position of your fingers on the keyboard. This makes it more comforatble to work with, because you don't necessarily have to readjust your fingers to get the right key response. The reach to some of the keys are a little strange until you get used it them. For example, the enter key is shorter than it used to be. So if your natural reach would get you to the inside edge of the enter key before, you will have a bit of a stretch in order to get to it. The backspace, shift, ctrl, caps lock, and tab all also have more reach required to get to them. With a little practice, however, it becomes much easier to hit them.The enhanced keys on this keyboard are really easy to use. They provide extra functionality and are simple to program. You get five favorite keys, which you can set to open folders, files, web pages, or whatever you want. You also get keys to increase or decrease the volume, open your home page, search, email, and even a key for the caclulator. In this keyboard, the enhanced F keys are great, and you don't have to reset the F-lock after each reboot. Over the number pad, there are some commonly used keys like equals, back and forward parentheses, and backspace. To some, this will make using the calculator easier. I don't mind them, but I wished that they could have put more functionable keys instead of those because they seem a bit redundant to me.There are also back and forward keys for use with the internet. I love these, because now I don't have to use the mouse to go backward or forward when I am surfing the net. I wish the zoom slider had been a scroll button, though. I don't really ever use the zoom function.One plus of this keyboard is that the basic special function keys are labeled for you. So you can see that the ctrl key has the asterisk, and that means that when you press ctrl and any key that has the asterisk on it, the function that is labeled by the key will occur.The unique ergonomics of this keyboard make it far superior than any natural keyboard that I have used. The reverse slope is genius. Turns out that the older design of keyboards was a carryover from the typewriters that needed a ton of finger pressure to use. Microsoft did a ton of research to find a new orientation for the keys, and it worked wonderfully. The slope allows me to type better and easier, while giving me full support for my wrists.This is really a revolutionary keyboard. I don't have the space to describe how great it is. You just have to try it and see for yourself how unique it is. It is so comfortable that I find myself still trying to get used to how pleasant it is to use.",1145577600

Yes, if you press it closer to the middle then it will work (but still requires far too much force to be considered ergonomic).  Why should anybody have to use a non-standard typing style to use a keyboard, though?  Doesn't that defeat the purpose of supposedly being ergonomic?  It's just really difficult to understand how such a bad design got onto the market.  Absolutely don't waste your time on this keyboard.",1194739200

"03 12, 2009","[1, 1]",3.0,COMFORT WITH COMPROMISES,B000A6PPOK,NeuroSplicer,A74TA8X5YQ7NE,"Recently I changed my PC and although my old keyboard (a MICROSOFT Multimedia) was still in perfect working condition, I decided to change the whole set up. I still had fond memories of my old MS NATURAL ELITE PRO keyboard I had used writing my Thesis, so I decided on the 4000 model which seemed to be its improved replacement. I have had the keyboard for about two months - here are my impressions:THE GOOD:- The 4000 is not just another beautiful keyboard but a REALLY comfortable one too. Not only are the curves natural and well molded but the minimally padded leather-imitation wrist-rest offers a silky sense of luxury. The keyboard comes out of the box with a negative angle attachment, which can easily be removed - it is comfortable but personally I need to see what I am typing.- Compared to other Ergonomic keyboards, one has to note that unless the keys are physically separated into two groups any ergonomic effects will be minimal. So, if you are thinking ofLogitech's Wave, it is a good idea to actually give both of them a try at a local store before making a choice. As I said, I am no professional typist (yes, more of a 2-fingers) yet I found that my typing is much faster and my typos more rare when using Natural keyboards.- I liked the idea of the BACK/FORWARD buttons at the wrist-rest. Although most mice now have this functions on their side buttons, it is still a big help when browsing (my mouse has a Magnifying Function where the FORWARD usually is).- Also, this is a really quiet keyboard. You get a satisfactory feeling when pushing a button but instead of an annoying ""clack"" sound only a muted ""tap"" is heard. Ideal if your wife is in the habit of taking naps in your home-office couch.- As an avid gamer favoring the right side of the keyboard (arrow keys instead of the WASD configuration) I enjoyed the ample room around the former.- Finally, I liked the placement of an extra set of EQUAL, PARENTHESIS and BACKSPACE at the top right corner (especially the parenthesis, I always hated finding the opening and closing one among the numbers)Now, THE BAD:- For some reason the ENTER and RIGHT SHIFT keys are too small! I could do with regular sized ""H"" and ""N"" keys if it would mean not hunting the ENTER. And this is a large keyboard, I doubt it would make any difference if it was yet a bit longer for that.- The SPACE bar is, well, fickle. Sometimes it works even if hit at the side. Others it refuses to respond unless hit at the middle.- The key letters and symbols have a tendency to rub off(!). This is totally unacceptable for a premium priced product - especially one sporting MICROSOFT's brand name. I decided to wait for the problem to become more pronounced and have this one replaced.- The Media keys on top do not sit well in their homings and are not perfectly aligned. Especially the VOLUME UP in my keyboard seems to rest at an angle. Again, poor quality control for such an expensive and brand name product.All in all: a mixed bag of good features but with compromises and inferior quality control. I REALLY miss my old NATURAL ELITE PRO keyboard - if it came in black I would buy one again.",1236816000

Simply put, as much as I would love a switch to something else I've just ordered a new one.

While my keyboards work decently, I was overcome with problems; the mechanical M1 keyboard was a poor keyboard for typing (the feeling was off and I was making an abnormal amount of typos) and my basic Logitech keyboard, a membrane kind, started off nicely but turned rather crappy as time went on.  It was time for a new keyboard.I was in a pinch between going after a new mechanical keyboard or an ergonomic one (you can have both, but the cost is prohibitive).  After some thought, I went with a cheaper route and for this keyboard.  Upon opening it, it looked great; sure, it wasn't PS/2 compatible, but the wrist support was superb. Build quality was great throughout, although it's no mechanical keyboard.  It was wonderful to put my hands on the wristpad (which was lightly padded and covered with faux leather--it's really better than it sounds), ready to type.Then I began typing.Problems began to surface.  The keys were too stiff; I don't remember any keyboards that required break-in periods. They are usually shipped new and that's the best condition for the keyboards; it goes downhill as they age.  The keyboard layout, I could nitpick about, but seeing as it's an ergonomic keyboard, there's no reason to (it's probably better to adapt than to whine about it).  The dealbreaker, though, is the spacebar.It's an ill-conceived, ill-designed, ill-manufactured piece of junk.  Not only is the force required to type with it high, it often refuses to be pressed. Sometimes it gets stuck. Overall, whatever good thing I had to say about the keyboard, the godforsaken spacebar tosses it out the window.I should've listened to the online reviews and pass up the opportunity to get this keyboard.  It's a shame the keyboard types nothing like it looks--it looks beautiful and functional, but that's about it.  Fix the spacebar! Then I am willing to give this keyboard a shot again.",1317168000

I find the angle and palm rests comfortable, and the split form factor is helping me to correct some touch typing bad habits. The palm rests are made of a high quality material that doesn't cause my hands to sweat. The keys are soft but substantive, and relatively quiet. I have an olderLogitech Cordless MX Duoand find its keys to be somewhat less comfortable and louder... except for the spacebar. The spacebar on this keyboard appears to be positioned on a single, central scissor or spring, so that it proves stiff to push from the left or right sides of the bar--the natural place to press it with your thumbs. This sometimes results in missing spaces. And when it does go down, it makes a distinct thunk as it bottoms, unlike the relatively quieter operation of the other keys. You can definitely hear when you're starting a new word.I like that the special function keys all work on the Mac, and are easy to assign and customize using the unobtrusive Microsoft IntelliType software. The Logitech has a much more limited number of special keys, and most of them still don't work on the Mac. Between IntelliType and Expos&eacute;, these buttons offer a wealth of usability and integration with the Mac OS. There are alternate function keys with frequently used actions (toggled using F-lock) and special buttons for Home/Web, Search, Mute, etc. and 5 ""Favorites"" buttons. All can be programmed to launch appropriate apps or perform specific functions.

I bought this new one because the one I used to have doesn't have USB interface. Compared with the old one, this one has three differences:1. Arrangements of insert, delete, home, end, page up and down keys. Microsoft decided to change them back to the layout of ""normal"" keyboards. This might be good for some people, but not for someone who's used to the new layout (you can call that layout weird, but I found it pretty good once I got used to it).2. This keyboard is raised. I thought it would be too high for me and would seem unnatural, but it turns out to be pretty comfortable.3. The keyboard is split in the middle, with an angle. However, as they move towards the edge (The ctrl, shift, enter, etc keys), they become parallel again. This was not true for the old natural multimedia keyboard. I actually found this to be not as good as the old one. This is because I can have a natural wrist angle when I'm typing on most of the keys, but whenever I want to press the ctrl keys, I have to bend my wrist outwards to press them, which is extra movement I do not want, and would make my hands tired pretty soon. If I do not use the raiser, my wrist would have to bend a lot to press those keys. This really hurts. (that's why I need the raiser, which alleviates the problem, but still doesn't solve it) I don't know why MS decided to do this, but I actually find the layout of their old product better.The multimedia keys are pretty handy though.Anyway, this is still much more comfy than those normal keyboards out there.",1141776000

After going through the original one and then the replacement I have purchased another one!  I suspect that the disappearing keys problem is still an issue because it looks the same as the other ones...time will tell.I have other keyboards: two that came with two HP PCs and a Logitech one purchased separately.  Now that I am used to the MS wide, curved layout I feel cramped using those.  With regular keyboards my arms feel as if plastered to my sides and quite cramped.  The Logitech keyboard is nice because it wireless but it doesn't match up to the MS keyboard in terms of comfort.I am still giving the MS keyboard 4 (up from 3) stars.  If it retained the ink on its keys and was wireless it would be darn near perfect.First update -------- I am updating this review since Microsoft replaced the keyboard and I am both surprised (!) and happy that they did.  I tried placing stickers on the keys and then writing on them but that didn't work.  I will take the advice from another reviewer about using nail polish on the keys to keep the letters from disappearing.  I think keyboards should last longer than this but Microsoft did stand behind their product so kudos for that service.I do not know what is happening to keyboards but so many of them seem fragile and poorly made.  My Dell laptop has keys that literally broke.  The plastic piece that attaches the key to the board broke on two keys.  The keyboards that came with a new HP computer were so awful that I threw them away in favor of the Microsoft one.  I am now trying a Logitech keyboard to see if someone can make a keyboard that works for at least a year.Original review ------ I can imagine that this is a good keyboard from an ergonomic perspective.  It has a very different feel from the standard flat keyboard and it takes up much more space as well.  It takes a good long while to get used to it but it is comfortable.The reason I would like to give it negative stars is that the printing on the keys is disappearing with less than 6 months of use.  OK, I know my keyboard layout but this is ridiculous.  Just for comparison's sake, I have a very standard beige keyboard that has keys in almost as bad a condition as this one.  That keyboard is 10 years old.On the Microsoft keyboard the E and R are almost completely gone and the I, K and S are close behind.

For many years I was an enthusiast, and then I spent 5 years as a computer repair guy in a local computer shop, after which I moved onto a job in the web hosting industry and spent 5 years mixed between tech support and management. I started using this keyboard during the management phase of my time at the web hosting company, and... wow. It really made a huge difference in my comfort level sitting at the desk. I had begun to develop a bit of carpel tunnel, tingling in my wrist and fingers, etc; after buying this keyboard, it all went away. I'm not suggesting that will be everyone's experience, just that it is my own.I've owned a whole lot of keyboards, and this is easily the best that I've ever used. It's rock solid, has perfectly sized keys and a nice, soft wrist rest built-in. A lot of these programmer types in the negative reviews have complained about the space bar being hard to strike, but that's not my experience; in my time with this keyboard, it's been a breeze.I almost never use the short-cut keys at the top; just never got in the habit. They work, though, for the record.At the beginning of this review I stated that I own 5 of these keyboards. I should add that I have also bought these for many people that I know, and they have all adjusted to it quite well and love it. No one I know first-hand has ever had any issue with it.",1296345600

However, the space bar causes problems for me. I tap the very right side of the space bar when I type, and it sticks. It doesn't stick if you tap the center of the bar, but that isn't comfortable (or quick) for me. Probably because the actuator is in the middle of the bar and the bar is so big. I don't know if this was just a defective keyboard, but I saw a couple of other reviews with the same problem. I ended up sending the keyboard back, only because I am really finicky when it comes to keyboards.I gave this four stars because everything else about the keyboard was what i wanted. Layout of the buttons (including the 6-key cluster), depth of buttons, add-ons, wrist rest, and the bottom supports at the front of the keyboard instead of the back. But I just couldn't get past the space bar. The way I rate these things, the keyboard would have to get a 5-star rating in order for me to keep it. I also tried the Logitech Wave keyboard, and althought there are no space bar issues, the Logitech keyboard is inferior compared to this one IMO.

It has plenty of extra keys that can be used to bind to useful commands including media control (it is really noisy in our office so can't concentrate properly without music).My biggest problem though (the reason that I subbed 2 stars) is the lack of configuration. The only way to access the extra keys is through the microsoft keyboard and mouse center which is a really limited utility and also the fact that the knob in the middle is set to &#34;zoom&#34;. From their utility you have only 2 options - &#34;zoom&#34; or nothing. (btw &#34;zoom&#34; is just ctrl+scroll) And it is impossible to make it scroll (a much more useful function in my opinion) without hacking through the configuration xml files and even after doing so - one of updates just reseted everything so I'm back to &#34;zoom&#34; and I can't use a different hotkey manager to control that, since only the microsoft utility can work with these extra keys.P.S.: same thing goes for the &#34;favorites&#34; button and the whole &#34;Fn&#34; thing (why is it a toggle?!

Wrist injury or arthritis?  This keyboard is perfect.When I discovered a few years ago how much easier it is to type on an ergonomic keyboard, I set out to find the best one for me.  This one was it.  I tried Logitch, Fellowes, and a few others I can't remember.  Some split, some wave.  When I sat down and started typing with this keybaord for the first time, I knew I had found the Mercedes of keyboards.There are a few ""problems"" which keep it from getting 5 stars from me.1. The space bars do tend to need an extra kick from time to time to get them to depress.2. No backlight.3. No macro buttons for gaming.The spacebar issue can be overcome through use.  Once you've used the keyboard enough it will loosen up, and you will also program yourself to subconsciously give it a little more encouragement when you hit it.The lack of a backlight is becoming a killer for me.  As my eyes get older I find it more difficult to see the letters on the keyboard.  I am not a touch typist, though I can type around 80 error-free wpm while keeping the keys in my peripheral vision.  Backlighting would help me to keep track of the keys.Macro buttons...I play games on my computer as well, and macro buttons (like on the Microsoft Sidewinder series) would be welcomed.If you are looking for an exellent general use keyboard, and have any of the issues I noted above, you should get this keyboard.  It takes a week or so to really get the hang of the split keyboard, but once you get it, you will find it near impossible to type on a regular keyboard.I have two of these...one for home and one for work.To be completely honest, I just bought the MS Sidewinder X4 to replace the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 at home.  I do less typing there now than when I was in grad school, and much less than at work (where my job is writing things all day).  The Sidewinder X4 solves all three issues I have with this keyboard...it does however introduce new issues...like wrist allignment and such, but for gaming I just reposition the keyboard as needed.At work?  No question...it's Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, and only Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 that will work for me.If only MS would put out a split key ergo keyboard with backlighting, I'd give it 6 stars.",1350000000

"06 7, 2006","[2, 2]",4.0,"Ooo, comfy!",B000A6PPOK,Paul Gabriel Wiener,A1PFWFHIVAKQNI,"Features:Comfort. The most comfortable keyboard I've used. The curves take a little getting used to, but it's worth it. Even the (suede-covered and padded) palm rest is subtly curved (in 3 dimensions!) to fit your hand exactly right. A removable prop allows for negative tilt, if that suits your fancy (it's a lot more comfortable than it first seems it should be). Overall, there's a reason they call the design ""natural."" Every aspect is perfectly suited to the way my hands naturally go.Buttons. Standard 101-key layout plus some handy extras. Top row gives you quick access to frequently used programs. There are buttons for your web browser, the search panel (a sidebar in a folder window to search for files and such), and email. Next to that are five ""favorites"" buttons, which you can easily program to open any programs or run any command line you like. The * button below them brings up a window that reminds you of the current settings and lets you change or update them. Next to that are a mute button, volume up and down, play/pause, and calculator. You can also reprogram any of the buttons to serve a different function if it so suits you. Above the number pad is a row with =() and backspace keys, which make for convenient additions. At the bottom, just below the spacebar, are a pair of unobtrusive keys which function as back and forward browser buttons. All in all, these extra buttons are quickly spoiling me. They save a lot of mousing around.Zoom Slider. Supposedly, it lets you zoom in or out on just about any window. It doesn't work exactly as advertized for me (I'm using XP Pro), but I don't mind. With Firefox, it works as a scroll stick. In IE, it tries to simultaneously scroll and zoom. Text gets bigger or smaller as you move up and down the page. It's kind of funny, but not really useful. Not a big deal, though, as scrolling in IE can be easily accomplished with the mouse or arrow keys. The slider does work perfectly in WordPad, smoothly adjusting the text size up or down with the touch of a finger.Construction:The plastic is a good balance between lightweight and durable. It's not featherweight, but it's significantly lighter than a lot of older keyboards. Even so, it still feels reassuringly solid.One thing I did notice is that my favorite corner of the spacebar (where my right thumb rests) wore smooth within a day. The key is intact, and the other keys are still in pretty much perfect condition, but the thin traction coating rubbed off in that spot.Typing Volume:It's not whisper-quiet, but it's not embarassingly or disruptively loud, either. Slightly softer than average, I'd say. A bit louder than my laptop's built-in keyboard (which has the advantage of flatter keys and a solid surface beneath it, both of which reduce echoes).Layout:One commenter mentioned the oversized TGBYHN keys. That's actually fairly standard with split keyboards. It's just that most of them make those keys into plateaus, with the extra space at base level. I actually like this way better. It's got a cleaner look, and the keys work just fine no matter where I hit them.Summary: If you like split keyboards, go with this one! The worst thing about it is how much you'll miss it when you have to use a different one.",1149638400

I use the music controls at the top, and the calculator...but I don't really care about the shortcut keys.

I settled on this model, thinking it would fit the bill for my home office.  When I got the unit, I was immediately surprised and dismayed, because I could not tell from the picture that the keyboard is wavy on the vertical axis.  I know it is described as an ergonomic keyboard, so that is partially my fault, but it has wrist support, and the keys appear to be arced on the horizontal axis, so I thought that was where the ergonomics started and stopped.  Not so.  The keyboard has a VERY prominent hump where the home row keys are split, and the space bar falls on this split.  I'm sure there are many people who can take to this type of layout right away and wonder what their hands have been missing their whole lives, but not I.  In addition to the hump making it feel very awkward like I had never typed before, but also the spaebar is centered squarely on the hump, with only one point of actuation on the hump, so if you don't take extra care to press down deliberately hard, close to the center, the spacebar won't register a keystroke.  If I had to write this review with that keyboard, it would have taken me 20 minutes because I would have to backspace and then peck at the spacebar with my index finger, novice typist style, to make sure it registers a keystroke.  The combination of the hump and the difficult to press spacebar made me decide within about 3 minutes that I couldn't keep the keyboard.  For those of you that like this thing, more power to you, but as a touch typist, even without the hump, the spacebar is disruptive enough to take me back to about 20 wpm with constant corrections, if even that.",1368144000

"10 5, 2005","[11, 14]",4.0,"Great keyboard, poor software.",B000A6PPOK,"Revrant ""Garrett Cosgrove""",AFPGV3IQ9K691,"As with most Microsoft products, great hardware, poor software, but oh well.Now I'm using this thing right now, and I never noticed the spacebar thing, but it's true, if you don't press the spacebar correctly and press it on the upper area, it's hard to press down. I've always pressed spacebars as they were meant to be pressed so I had no issues adjusting.The largest challenge with this keyboard is using home row correctly, Microsoft puts out products based on the standard, and has done this with its' Natural line since the start. I use my left hand correctly, my right, on my Logitech Elite, went all over the place; I can only imagine how wrong my right hand usage was. This keyboard forces you to relearn typing, for typing classes, a Natural keyboard would be perfect, it makes you type correctly. I don't much like the N key, but I've learned to use it and the M key correctly, no more hitting my enter key while going for quotes either.The zoom function is novelty, not necessity, it's fun to use normally but mostly useless otherwise, really exclusively for the always-in-office user, what they need to do is make it a scroll button too, it's highly sensitive and easy to use, which would make scrolling silky smooth in a way only overpriced mice manage.Therein lies the problem, the software is inferior to my cheapie Logitech Elite(Which had more functions I might add as well as better software.), there is hardly any customization to be had. There is no taskbar icon; most of the remapping done is through an interface integrated into the already well-hidden Keyboard area under the control panel. Remapping options are less than fantastic, the favorites keys are useless, the back and forward buttons will work with either a browser or a media player, not both, zoom cannot be reconfigured, and Mail only allows one indicated program to be opened.This is what is wrong with the favorite's keys, they allow but five programs to be opened, you cannot indicate that you wish to open a menu of programs to select, merely one program per key, same with all of the other keys. The lack of ""My"" keys for the F# Buttons is annoying, but that's just a design decision for a non-media keyboard, and I don't mind much.This keyboard would've done better to have more configuration and just a couple more media keys, but I suppose it's my fault for asking that much of it, it's designed for the office, not a music listeners hands. I'll go into the aesthetics of this baby now to round it off.Some may notice the shift keys are smaller, and the enter key even smaller, the right of the keyboard is larger than the left in the way of keys, which seems fine, to me at least, I find reaching the Backspace key uncomfortable, placing your hands on this keyboard is like a match made in heaven, seems a shame to reach so far away and break off from paradise.That leads me to this palm rest, wow, sick of those cheap detachable plastic palm rests(Read: Wrist Destroyers)? This is your ticket, so soft, yet strong, it's the cashmere of palm wrests. The 2x3 layout is back to normal, which I very much enjoy, insert is back home and delete is too. The keys above the numpad offer more functions that I have yet to use, but are nice to have all the same, the curvature of the keys takes getting used to, particularly the aforementioned N key and it's sibling the M key. The Alt, Ctrl, Windows, Menu, and Start keys are all gigantic and hard to miss, they feel pretty great.The spacebar, apparently if struck correctly, is amazing, it's designed for this keyboard in a way that no spacebar has ever been, it's almost destructive of what you're typing looking down while you type, seeing it all functioning the way it does, it's almost like some kind of alien technology, which is why I don't look.The...crappy plastic attachment that comes attached(Oddly enough) to this masterpiece is best taken out(Easily) and forgotten, it's all personal preference of course, I didn't like it, the slope of the keys makes leaving your hands where they are painless and then very comfortable. The prop-ups on the back make it more conventional and I rather like them, but now the size.This keyboard is undeniably the largest keyboard I have ever laid eyes on, the sheer width and height is enough to make a laptop user gawk for moments at a time, it is critical you have a large amount of desk space to place this on, I didn't, and I had to move my entire PC over more to the left just to manage a nice cozy fit. When the legs on this baby are propped it also reaches monitor height, I.E., it will not fit very well under a monitor, which is why it is best used in a keyboard tray, though I'd worry about it's large scale hurting the tray after a long enough time.In conclusion, this is a masterful piece of hardware, and it has virtually no flaws, the software is pathetic at best and obviously designed for the dullard worker drone, it's a pity really, all the same, it deserves four stars, here's to hoping they manage to improve the boring, bland software.8/10 (Not an average)",1128470400

So it has the normal kickstands for the back of the keyboard and it comes with an added ramp (per say) that attaches to the front. The ramp makes it where you hands are lined with your wrist and forearm. You can remove the ramp and the keyboard lays at a slant as the basic keyboards do. Ive tried both with and without the ramp and chose the ramp because it just makes my hand position natural and relaxed.I love the short cut keys (favorites; volume; play/pause; calculator; email; home; search etc).I have no cons for this item; however, if I were to add anything to this keyboard I would add the keyboard cover to help prevent dust and crumbs from entering the keys.

"08 18, 2011","[3, 3]",5.0,Best keyboard I could find!,B000A6PPOK,Richard W. Carter,ACSOZY9RAUY3P,"I am a programmer; I spend 8 hours at my job writing code, then go home and work on my own personal coding projects. Suffice to say my keyboards get a LOT of use, at speeds above 100 wpm, utilizing all the symbols and special keys.I've been just using whatever keyboard I could find or was given, but just decided I need to get a good keyboard. I've had a couple minor wrist problems but nothing chronic, so I just felt like I needed an actually decent keyboard since it is something I use 100% of the time I'm at my computer.I did my research and ended up choosing this one at the advice of other programmer reviews of it (e.g. Coding Horror). Everything about it is standard, which is absolutely critical to me: the backspace key is double-wide, the modifier keys are in the standard Ctrl-Win-Alt order, escape key is inline with function keys, insert/delete/home/end are normal size and layout. The extra buttons on the keyboard are nice, though I seldom use them and wouldn't miss them if this was just a standard keyboard.The ergonomics of the keyboard are nice. I like the prop thing that comes with it and haven't removed it. The wrist rests are very soft and comfortable. The split layout doesn't take any time to get accustomed with; I just type like I normally do and my fingers are still hitting the right keys despite my hands being spread apart.I don't prefer the feel of the keys; they have more of a mushy feel to them than I'm used to. But it's perfectly tolerable, given all the rest of the features of this keyboard, and I understand that every keyboard has a different feel. It's not difficult to type on, just different from what I'm used to.The build quality is acceptable; the soft wrist pad feels very good quality, but the rest of the keyboard seems pretty mediocre. I suppose this is how they managed to get so much keyboard in so little price - I'm not saying it's not durable, it just doesn't feel expensive. No fancy aluminum here.It's totally cross platform! I've already used it on both Windows 7 and OS X Lion, and in both cases I had a very good experience. I downloaded and installed the software from Microsoft's website, ignoring the included CD, before plugging in the keyboard. In Windows, the keyboard works exactly as expected - and as it should, given it's a Microsoft keyboard. In Mac, it was recognized immediately and the keys default to the mapping familiar with Mac users; so where Mac keyboards have the order Control-Option-Command, this keyboard too takes on that order (""Ctrl"" = control, ""windows"" = alt/option, ""alt"" = command). The special keys also work as expected by default, and are totally configurable in a prefpane in System Preferences. I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this Mac driver.Overall, I love the keyboard and will be recommending it to anyone who is in the market for a keyboard! It even looks to be perfectly good for gaming - I'll need to test that. :)",1313625600

I personally type hard and like the feel of the keys.  Some reviews mentioned that the space bar is loud. I definitely agree with that remark.  The space bar is the loudest key on the keyboard but I think it has to do with the fact that the space bar sits on the curve center portion of the keyboard.  It is the only key in that positon.  Overall, for the price, you can't beat the quality of the keyboard.  It is a Microsoft product and worth the money.  Do I wish the space bar wasn't so loud?

My last one took a small splash of tea around the 'asdf' and 'zxc' area, after which several letters, and the main 'Enter' key were nonfunctional.

"02 19, 2014","[0, 0]",2.0,"Inferior to older ""Natural Keyboard Elite""",B000A6PPOK,"Robert Swindell ""digital man""",A18KO925KQXPY6,"I'm a long time Microsoft Natural (ergonomic/split) keyboard owner/user, of several models. I've been using the ""Natural Keyboard Elite"" (white, PS/2 connector) at work and home/office for over 10 years. A bottle of Snapple Peach Tea (my favorite) was spilled on my home keyboard recently. Immediate shaking and blotting did not save it and the next day, several of the keys were obviously hard to push and slow to retract (""gummed up"" is the technical term I think). I've ""washed"" keyboards before (by hand and via dishwasher) with mixed results and before I chanced anything with this keyboard, I looked for a new one. Of course Microsoft doesn't make the ""Elite"" anymore and this keyboard (the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"") was the closest I could find, so I ordered it for next day delivery.I don't consider myself a keyboard snob, but I guess I am, as so much about this keyboard bothers me. I guess I'll start with the positives though.Pros:* Split/humped design is good for your hands/wrists and possibly other joints and spine (plus other people will be dissuaded from trying to use your computer)* Real full-throw keys, not chicklets or membrains (though lower profile than the old ""Elite"" keys)* Wired (no batteries to replace or radio signals to intercept or jam)* Soft wrist pad is comfy* Extra buttons/scroll/zoom/app controls can be convenient* Full-size pyramid-style dedicated arrow keys (unlike the smaller 'T' layout on the ""Elite"")* The num pad is perfectly normal except for unnecessary ""rounding"" of the keys* The additional mathmatical/algebraic keys above the num pad are cool, but (3 of them) require special MSFT software to enable - spreadsheet ""programmers"" probably really like these (=, (, ), and backspace)Cons:* Keys are ""mushy"", especially the space bar - this is my biggest gripe with this keyboard* Space bar has a weird initial resistence to press and after exerting sufifcient force, makes a very audible ""plunk"" sound as the key reaches the floor - this happens with either the left or right thumb/side of the space bar (or dead-center press)- Every other key is extremeliy quiet, onliy the space bar provides the periodic annoying ""plunk""* Keys are asymetrical (e.g. the 'N' key is about 3-times wider than the 'M' key, '7' is at least twice as wide as '8' and '6' is smaller than any normal key) - if you're a touch typist, these don't matter so much but the keyboard occasionally feels very strange when I feel the edges of keys that are completely foreign to me* Function keys are about 2/3 size (similar to the ""Elite"", but rounded) and have that stupid ""[F] Lock"" thing* USB only (hey, some of us like to use our USB ports for other stuff and that PS/2 port is just going to waste)* No USB hub functionality (as long as it's going to eat a USB port on my system, give me another port to plug my mouse or other HID into)* Keyboard is about 4"" deeper than the old ""Elite"" model - this thing's a beastSo I've ""washed"" my Elite and blown it out with an air compressor. Hopefully that'll return it to the previous state and I can stop using this black beast (I do prefer the color though).If you love this keyboard, more power to you, it's just not for me (or my fingers, or my ears)!UPDATE: I purchased the Perixx PERIBOARD-512W (I guess I prefer white afterall) from Amazon and immediately (and happily) stopped using the Microsoft 4000.

I attributed this to the unusual wave design of the key layout which is supposed to promote stress free typing, which is does -- but while promoting a bad style of typing preventing the keyboard user from typing all other keys!  Hence, you're likely to use this keyboard for online irc chat rooms and quick chatting where you don't use anything but lower case letters!I've recently purchased a Unicomp ""Customizer 104/105 (P/N UB4044A)"" mechanical (spring) keyboard along with a Leopold FC3456-A (brown switch) mechanical keyboard.  Although the Leopold brown switch keyboard I can type extremely fast, it's size and key layout is smaller causing numerous mistypes.  The Unicomp keyboard, I can type much better, but not as fast as the Leopold due to the stiffer springs while mistypes are much fewer.  I can also find finger/hand placement much easier and faster on the Unicomp board.  The Unicomp keyboard has a raised stepping for it's keys, providing more spacing for those of us with muscles in our hands.  Only gamers are going to like the smaller keybaords, as they can place the keyboard in their laps unlike those of use that work and need a desk for typing.In brief, it took me weeks to relearn how to properly type so I could type numbers and other characters using META and Shift keys!  I don't think I'll ever buy another ergonomically styled key layout keyboard again!  I find it strange since we invented typewriters, the QWERTY keyboard has survived this long while the typewriter manufacturers never created an ""ergonomically styled typewriter""???  But all of a sudden the IBM style keyboards almost disappeared and replaced with these plastic switch keyboards.  (Sorry for the lack of clarity within the last couple of sentences, but the thought is there, it's just not described very well. :-/)Anyways, I'm more privy to use the Unicomp keyboard when using VIM and will save the Leopold for typing very long reports.As for these Microsoft keyboards, they really good for the price, but beware you'll take several weeks to learn how to type on them and then once you grow tired of them after a year, you'll need to relearn how to type for several weeks on another style of keyboard.  My advice, stick with the IBM Model M layout.  They've been around for a long time, likely for a reason!2013.01.08: If you type a lot, then try buying a keyboard with softer keys, allowing easy touch-typing.  A good option I'm liking, except for the smallness or the ""less then actual size keyboard or typewriters"", are the Leopold keyboards (ie. Model FC3456-A). Keys seem closer together then the above Unicomp IBM Model M keyboard, and my fingers are far from being fat! These smaller keyboards seem to be great for little kid hands/fingers.  However, I can at least touch type compared to using the stiffer keys of the Unicomp keyboard.",1321056000

Nellis ""Patent pragmatist""",A1RAQTGK72I82Q,"At my previous job, I asked for a natural keyboard since I was starting to have wrist pain (a decade of gaming and computer-based jobs will do that). I ended up going with this one since it had the padded wrist rest and had the option of raising the front end, which I thought would be novel.After using it for a few days, I wouldn't have traded it for any keyboard in the world (not even the IBM clackers in the supply closet). The keys were responsive, the calculator key worked without installing additional drivers, and (most importantly) my wrist pain had faded away. I was totally hooked and have not purchased a non-ergonomic keyboard since.I switched jobs last year and had to leave the 4000 behind since it was bought with company funds. I was supplied with the basic Microsoft ergonomic keyboard that has sold for $10 for years now. I just went with it since I'm a pragmatist at heart; it got the characters on the screen and my wrists didn't hurt. But after seeing the 4000 on a deal site for ~$30, I decided to regain the joy I had previously experienced.When it arrived, I decided to give it a little trial at home. After half an hour or so, it seemed that the H, Y, and M keys did not register under normal pressure. I decided to take it to work anyway since I assumed my changed typing form was to blame. After using it for an entire work day, I was on the phone with the vendor (Amazon seller) telling them they needed to send me a replacement. We cross-shipped, and I got one with 100%-working keys. Finally, back to bliss, I thought.After a week of using it at work, my wrist pain came back. I couldn't figure it out since I had used the same model keyboard in the same position (roughly) for a few years without problems at my last job. I initially looked at my mouse, but changing its position didn't help. Changed the height on my chair, how I sat, and other variables. As a last resort, I took the elevating attachment off the front. Within three days, the wrist pain was gone again.Based on using an older unit for a few years and using one bought just months ago, I think the quality level has suffered. A friend also ordered one from the Amazon seller when I did, and he also had to return his first due to defective behavior. The key action seems a lot muddier than I remembered and is definitely slower/softer than the $10 beige wonder I'm typing on now. The space button squeaked rather loudly after using it for a few days, but a can of silicone took care of that.This has found a place in my secondary office location. Nostalgia might cloud my judgment a little when comparing to my old unit, but for purely typing purposes right now, I prefer the basic ergonomic Microsoft offering to the 4000. If the additional function buttons and scroller appeal to you, you would probably be better off with the 4000.You might look at other dates of other reviews; I would have given that older unit five stars plus, but the newer one gets three stars for the initial product and four after I removed the elevating attachment and took care of the squeaking.Pros: ergonomic, several customizable function buttons, scroller in the middle, better home key layout, looks cool.Cons: keys aren't as responsive as others, raised front might cause wrist problems for some.",1238371200

After thinking I might have carpal tunnel (it turned out to be something different), I purchased this keyboard because it appeared to be the best thing available without getting into some very expensive (and very weird) configurations.I have been very pleased with this product in every respect - so pleased that I bought one for my office as well as my home.PROS:- Five totally programmable buttons for launching programs, actions, or websites I use frequently- Highly ergonomic- Excellent padded support for the heels of the hands- Zoom and webpage navigation buttons- Easy-to-see, well-placed lights on the keyboard for caps lock, function lock, scroll lock, and number lock- Nice selection of pre-programmed shortcut keys (calculator, web, search, mail) that can be re-mapped to other actions if desired- Very solid construction...good heft to the keys and just the right amount of tactile feedback.  It does not feel ""cheap.""- Good adherance to my work surface/desktop.  It does not slide around.- Rugged.  I've used mine for well over a year with absolutely no problems.- Color: hides dirt and is stylish.CONS:- Not available as wireless- Not enough controls for CD player (only play/pause...would like eject, FFWD, Track, etc.)I will warn those who have not used an ergonomic keyboard that it takes some getting used to.  But after you have used it for awhile, ""conventional"" keyboards will feel awkward and cramped, and you'll notice the unnatural angle that they force upon your wrists.I have used several ergo keyboards over the years and can categorically say that this is the best of the bunch.  Microsoft is the leader in the ergo keyboard market, and they've obviously spent money studying the biomechanics of what makes for a good design.  However, while many of their keyboards have the familiar v-shaped split to the character keys, none have the sting-ray like curved profile of this keyboard, and that is what makes all the difference.As I mentioned above, I thought at one time that I might have carpal tunnel, but it turned out to be an unrelated problem.  However, I am very happy that I switched to this keyboard anyway.  With as much time as I spend at the computer each day, this keyboard may very well have PREVENTED me from getting carpal tunnel.  I use it in conjunction with a Logitech wireless laser mouse (MX-1000) that I love as well and which I have reviewed elsewhere on Amazon.If Microsoft would address the few CONS that I outlined above, I think they would have the perfect keyboard.

While today's keyboards aren't as horrible as some of my youth--here's looking at you, Commodore 64!--they nonetheless can cause various maladies to development if used constantly.  In my line of work as a network administrator and full-time family tech support geek I'm typing quite a lot, and I remember seeing Microsoft's announcement about their new &#34;Natural&#34; Keyboard, back around 1994 or 1995.  I laughed at it--it looked silly, what with the split down the middle and the angling of the keys on each side.  It was as if Dali had spoken to someone at Microsoft and won the bet in a bar...Right.  Well, around 1998 I started getting both numbness and painful cramping in my wrists and hands.  Guess what?  I ended up trying that original, bizarre Natural keyboard and it was TOUGH.  Took a great deal of training, trying to re-acclimate my hands to where the keys had been moved, and my typing speed hit a brick wall during the process.  Thankfully, however, after untold Mavis Beacon sessions and lessening pain and numbness, I persevered.I now use this current model, the MS Natural Keyboard 4000, on all my desktop computers and laptops with docking stations.  I can attest firsthand the difference it has made in the quality of my life, given my line of work: I don't have to take pain medications constantly, I'm not relegated to using voice dictation software and suffering the speed and accuracy penalties often associated with it, and I don't dread long-term input sessions.PRO's:--Relatively inexpensive--Not gaudy in appearance; black, grey, and silver colors don't stand out in a professional environment--Keys are fairly quiet (although this could be a &#34;con&#34;--see below)--Wired - no batteries to replace or recharge!--Numlock, Shiftlock and Capslock lights are centrally located and easily seen--Integrated wrist rest is sloped just about right and uses a sort of anti-sweating material.  It works well for me.--Most important feature: the angling &#34;in&#34; of the two halves of the keyboard allow the wrists to be more or less &#34;at ease&#34; when typing, resulting in lower stress on the joints and muscles when compared to traditional flat-across keyboards.CON's:--Keys are fairly quiet; if you want a keyboard with deafening clackety-clack audible and tactile feedback, this rubber-dome keyboard isn't for you.  Get an old IBM buckling springs one instead.--Due to the rubber-dome nature of the construction, this keyboard won't last forever (unlike some of those old IBM keyboards mentioned above--wow).  However, that said, I type a great deal and still manage a good 3-4 years on these before I start having one or two keys fail to work 100% of the time.--The retraining period isn't easy and may well take a bit longer than you'd expect; stick with it, though, and it's quite likely you just might end up typing _faster_ than on standard old keyboards--and hurting less, to boot!BOTTOM LINE:It's a bit of a specialty market product, perhaps...  but if you're a person suffering from carpal tunnel/RTI or other issues around your wrists when you type, you owe it to yourself to at least try this style of keyboard.

(This can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on how long you've been using the Microsoft proprietary layout.)- Very nice key feedback: soft and quiet, but a very clear response.- ""Tilt-down"" just like the very early models (and some competitor models) used to have. This is definitely the most ergonomic keyboard in a while. Note that you can easily remove the tilt down piece, if you choose to.Getting used to the slightly different key layout (the keys arch up on each side of the split) took a few hours, but is working great for me now.This keyboard is large though. It is practically too big for my keyboard drawer: the keyboard does not fully emerge from under the desk and I cannot close my keyboard drawer anymore.The additional keys above the numeric keypad are remarkably handy. Microsoft added the =, (, ) and backspace keys. When using the calculator (or Excel), these keys really do speed up the data entry process.However, the very best feature is just a small change I've been hoping for ever since Microsoft re-assigned the function keys to have a dual action, depending on the F-Lock status.

While I liked the comfort curve keyboard, it wasn't a true ergonomic, and it gave me problems in gaming.  So when I saw that MS had redone the Natural Keyboard Pro, I jumped on it.  The reverse slope feels different at first but it isn't difficult to get used to at all.  The attachment does come off if you don't like it though.  The keyboard feels very well put together, typical of MS periphrials in my experience.I noticed that one user had complained about the software.  If you've used Intellitype before, don't expect anything new in version 5.3, which ships with this keyboard.  As far as I can tell, the only thing added was support for the new keyboards.  I have no major faults with it, although I've never owned a Logitech keyboard so I'm unable to compare it with their software.The only downsides to this keyboard are that the keys, despite having good feel and feedback are pretty quiet; it's not a clicky keyboard.  Also, with the reverse slope attachment on, it's a very high keyboard, something to keep in mind if you use a keyboard drawer or tray.

The failure rate for these keyboards is very high compared to our standard HP and Lenovo keyboards. They just are not durable. We've had many fail because the cord gets an open or short circuit. We've had even more get the dreaded stuck key issue. Even though the key doesn't appear to be physically stuck, but the key will repeat itself ad infinitum.

I spend 10+ hours a day in front of a computer. After YEARS of use, they are old, discolored, and grimy. After my coworkers commented on how grimy they are, I finally decided to purchase this keyboard as a replacement.I prefer the key layout that features the 2x3 Insert/Home/Delete/End keypad and the mostly horizontal arrow keys. Several manufacturers of other natural keyboards like to stack these keys up. I'm happy to say the original key layout is used on this keyboard (which you can see in the pictures).The key press on this keyboard is much quieter than the MS Natural Pro was, but the key presses are still authoritative and confident. The note has moved from a &#34;clickety-clack&#34; to more of a low &#34;thunk.&#34; If you're on a solid desk, it makes nearly no noise at all. One of my desks is a bar-height wall mount, so the thunk is a little louder there, but this is in no way a show stopper. The space bar is the loudest key.I've read a lot of other reviews about the space bar being hard to press. Initially, I definitely noticed a slight difference. After a day's use, either the space bar has &#34;broken in,&#34; or I simply don't notice it any more. Again, not a show stopper.If you're transitioning from a &#34;normal&#34; keyboard to a &#34;natural&#34; one, I highly encourage it.

I'd be shocked if you were very disappointed with this item unless the ""wave"" design is simply not for you.Mice though--different story.  Microsoft still has the cheapo, lightweight thing going on those.  Another reason to buy just this and go with another mouse.",1132531200

For the rest of them, the learning curve was steep as they first had to unlearn their existing crazy typing style and start all over again.

I purchased mine at best buy and I had to return 3 in the past 48 hours. The space bar is such a piece of #$%$@.. It keeps sticking or is extremely hard to press down. I spent alot of time on my computer and I cant waste time with this unreliable space bar. There is tons of hacks and tricks you can do online to get the keyboard to perform better. I tried some of them on the first 2 keyboard but it made them worse. So I finally just kept the 3rd one standard and I am going to hope the space bar unresponsiveness goes away over time. The store model was working great however I think its because thousands of people have pressed the space bar down and it fixed it. I am hoping this will be the same for me.

"12 26, 2010","[1, 1]",4.0,The (Almost) Perfect Ergonomic Keyboard From Microsoft,B000A6PPOK,"Vincent E. Martin ""Darkbard""",A3QMJMTLJC34QC,"Bottom-Line: Overall, I would state the Microsoft has designed a good, solid, useful, ergonomic keyboard with a lot to recommend it in the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.""Let's face it there is nothing sexy or even new about keyboard design, expect for the rise of backlit units.  But the keyboard is one of the most essential parts of the computer; after all, without one the computer is close to useless.I loved, loved, loved the feel and sound of the old IBM keyboards, but those old white units are hard to come by these days.  The white and black squares clicked and related a fair amount of feedback through the keys.  They keyboard on my HP Pavilion dv9000 approximates the feel and of the old IBM's but not the sound, but I like the keyboard nonetheless.The keyboard that ship with most dell desktop computers, like to one I use at work, are nice units, but they are almost too small for prolonged typing.  There is nowhere to rest the wrists while typing and that promotes fatigue with prolonged use, at least for me.  And over time, my left wrist will start to hurt.So the search has been on for quite some time for the perfect ergonomic keyboard; one that feels good underneath the fingers (provides feedback), provides adequate space for the wrists, while also preventing the dreaded wrist ailment c-tunnel syndrome.I've tried quite a few keyboards over the years so it was time to give Microsoft a try.  The ""Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" almost delivers.The 411Microsoft says of the Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 ""has been expertly crafted to allow you to work in a more natural position. The new Gull Wing design features a 14-degree gable, a natural arc and a curved key bed - bringing the keys closer to your fingers to reduce reach and unnecessary motion, while encouraging a more natural typing position. It also comes equipped with an optional palm lift for a seven-degree reverse slope and a cushioned wrist rest that encourages better arm and wrist alignment.""There are a myriad of silver special function keys throughout they keyboard face including a Zoom Slider that allows for the magnification of digital pictures, maps, etc.  There are also forward and back buttons designed for use with the Internet, as well as (5) customizable My Favorites Hot Keys that can be programmed to ""instantly open the programs, files, and Web pages you use the most.""Situated on the upper left hand side of the keyboard are three shortcut keys (Web/Home, Search, and Mail), while next to the My Favorites Hot Keys you'll find the typical multi-media controls.  Like most modern keyboards the function keys pull double duty depending on whether or not the F-Lock key is activated.With the F-Lock on, they perform their standard functions, however with the F-Lock off, the black keys execute a number of useful shortcuts, including save, print, undo/redo, and reply/forward/send for e-mail programs. An added bonus: the function keys are all labeled with their secondary functions.InstallationI installed the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" on a Dell DX4300 running Windows 7 Enterprise Edition.  The USB keyboard was recognized right away and all of the function keys worked without installing the included software.First ImpressionsThe first thing I noticed--and I am sure any user would--about the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" ($24.95 at Amazon.com) is that it's big!  But that is not necessarily a bad thing because the matt black keyboard had amble room for the wrists to rest while typing.  And the wrist rest are not made of hard plastic like most keyboards in this class; indeed the rests are cover in rubber giving the wrist a cushioned and comfortable place to rest.I immediately removed the palm lift; talk about awkward! The palm lift made typing on the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" a very difficult prospect.  Luckily it is easily removed.It is quite evident that Microsoft did not take a page from IBM's keyboard design book when placing they keys on this keyboard; they are hard to push for the most part and give little to no feedback.  Needless to say I do not care for them.  And because of the ""gull-wing"" design of the keyboard typing on the unit can take some getting used to.  After a few hours of typing on the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" I got used to the unique placement of the keys and I am happy to report that production is up!ConclusionThough the Microsoft ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" is certainly bigger than some of it contemporaries, that added space is well used.  I like the padded wrist rest, as well as the innumerable special function/programmable keys included in the design.I do not, however, like the feel of the keys, and the gullwing design took some getting used to.

"01 22, 2006","[7, 7]",4.0,"Great typing keyboard, but...",B000A6PPOK,"VladM ""reviewer07""",A3F9710KIUVDGC,"Pros: It's the most comfortable keyboard I've ever used, and I've been typing extensively for decades. If you've never used this type of keyboard before, it will take a little time, like a week or two to get used to the placement of keyes, but I'm sure you will be enjoying it more and more every day. Soft tactile response is exceptionally pleasant. The zoom slider would be excellent, if it always worked as intended (see below).Cons: I bought this keyboard to be sure it's compatible with my new 64-bit system. My reasoning was, if the 64-bit Windows are created by Microsoft and this keyboard is designed by Microsoft, the two must fit each other perfectly. Well, this is not exactly the case.Apparently Microsoft was too busy to design a native 64-bit driver for their keyboards. The driver that comes with this keyboard works with both the 32 and 64-bit Windows, but functionality in the 64- bit OS is limited. You can type fine and most function keys work as intended, but you can not use the volume up/down function even with the Microsoft Media Player in the 64-bit Windows, as it won't work. Also the zoom slider works fine in the MS Word and most IE browsing situations, but does not work with the 64-bit Mozilla (Deer Park version) and even in IE sometimes starts acting strange (such as suddenly becoming a scroll wheel, instead of a zoom). I guess, Microsoft shouldn't complain that many software and hardware companies ignore the 64-bit version of Windows, as they themselves keep ""forgetting"" about it.Another small drawback is that the ""Enter"" key is a bit too small for comfort. But I got used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore.My conclusion: This is a fantastic keyboard for anyone who types a lot. It literally makes typing a joy. Let's hope its functionality in Windows XP Pro x64 OS will be upgraded with a new native 64-bit driver in the near future.",1137888000

However, after a few days of using this newly redesigned keyboard, I was extremely disappointed and had to exchange it for a standard logitech keyboard.First, this keyboard is very large. This really isn't a problem. However, the tiny plastic feet that support the back of the keyboard can barely support it's weight. Any pressure on these feet will cause them to bend or break. Once looking at them, you'll easily see why.Second, it looks like Microsoft decided that since the keyboard was split and that they had extra room, they would change the size of a few lettered keys towards the middle so they are twice the size of a normal key! Add this to the fact that the keys feel ""squishy"" and you've got one crazy typing experience. It certainly does not feel natural at all. I really did try to get use to this, but I kept finding myself pressing incorrect keys, or having to look at the keyboard to make sure I hit the right key.The large hot keys at the top of the keyboard are a nice touch. But for media playback, it has a Play/Pause button, and that's it. No next, forward, back, or even a stop button. For no apparent reason, they are simply nowhere to be found.Now, it does feel comfortable (even though you can barely type at half your normal typing speed), and it looks great. And that's where the compliments end. I even had 2 other friends try out the keyboard, and they agreed... it's just not natural.Pros:- It looks great in black/silver- Comfortable to rest your hands on the keyboard- Keyboard has a good solid feel (excluding feet).Cons:- The tiny plastic feet are useless- Some letters on keyboard are larger than others (annoying)- Keys feel way too soft and offer no feedback- Missing extra media controlsWhile this keyboard may be ""comfortable"" and looks nice, it's just not practical for daily use if the feet break, the keys feel strange, and it slows down your typing experience.

The 4000 went back to the store the the next day and I replaced it with a Natural Keyboard Elite.The problem, that would be the space bar.  I really liked everything else about the product, but could not get around the space bar. It does NOT engage when pressed, usually on either of the outer areas at the corners.  I am a touch typist and this space bar significantly dropped by speed and increase my error rate.  I tried to train myself to press more to the center of the space bar which worked just fine, but time and time again I would find myself pressing one or the other of the ""little wings"" with the result of no action and no space produced.I have used the natural keyboard for 18 years and would choose nothing else.  But this keyboard is just very poorly designed for a touch typist.  A newcomer or hunt and pecker would probably not have this trouble with the space bar.I would have given it only one star but liked the other functionality of the keys and especially the raised lip on the bottom of the wrist side of the keyboard.  I have been using a negative angle on my keyboards for many years and just find that is the less stressful way to type.  (negative angle is when the edge of the keyboard where the space bar is,is higher than the further edge of the keyboard, where the function keys are).

The first one lasted 7 years and was priced around the same as this one if I remember correctly. Chose this over others as this is truly Ergonomic. I have the logitech wireless version and there was still a slight strain on my wrists that I don't have using this keyboard.This one is a bit lighter in weight than our older version, that's okay but it will allow it to slide easier. I just used some rubber matting underneath which keeps it stationary.I use the &#34;wired&#34; version as wireless is not necessary with my needs. This is used on a laptop and is plug into the USB hub and had no issue at all.I've worked in graphic design for years and the amount of typing is MUCH easier with these keyboards. I use the stylus mainly but these are still fantastic compared to straight keyboards. The only issue is the &#34;cushioned&#34; hand rest could have been thicker but I cut out some rubber foam from padding in the exact shape of the handrests to adhere on top and that works out great for additional comfort as well to raise your wrists up a bit higher. We have used several brands but for the cost and the comfort on your wrists this is a great keyboard for those of us on computers for 6 to 8 hours a day.",1404172800

The keys are now way too 'mushy', and the space bar is a bit iffy. It can take a considerable amount of force to register a press, and I sometimes have to backspace because of it.

Earlier models required you to hit the ""F-Lock"" key every time you booted.Happily, this keyboard remembers the state, so you only have to set it once. That's good enough for me!
