I should have known from the first pair of JLabs that I bought that these shouldn't be that much greater. For my money Skull Candy is by far a better bargin. I own 15 different pairs of in ears, including my Klipsch which there is no comparison to. I buy these off the wall brands as an extra pair for emergency purpose. I guess I will stick to Skull Candy after this experience. The only way you can determine the difference is to actually try them on and compare. See for your self. My go to for listening to my own recordings or any sound that I want the complete experience with are my Klipsch hands down. My kick around pair for just enjoying music for the best quality of it, will by no doubt be my Skull Candy. Enough said.

Here is what I found:* Whether speakers or headsets, I always start with Billy Thorpe's Children of the Sun, an amazingly complex and challenging piece. Passed with flying colours.* For bass (voice), I tested with Crash Test Dummies, Josh Turner and Johnny Cash. Beautiful lower register, rich and lush.* For treble (instruments), I used Nickel Creek and Chris Stills. Crisp. Brilliant highs with impeccable note distinction.* For wide-ranging vocals, I used Sweet Honey in the Rock and the majestic Pavane Op 50 (Paper Music by Bobby Ferrin). Amazing. Every voice is distinct and rich.* For precision, I use Beggerman (Gaelic Storm), Heard it on the X (ZZ Top), Radar Love (Golden Earring) and Yo Yo Ma's Appalachian Journey. Just blew it out of the park. I could hear Ma's fingers slide along the cello and Dusty's finger slip across frets.Now for some misses:* Werewolves of London (Warren Zevon) lacked the depth I get from even Altec speakers.* Friends of the Devil (Grateful Dead) lost the precision I expect from the vocals; the instrumental opening is perfection, but I guess Jerry's voice just doesn't fit into the spectrum these are designed to portray.* Volume is WEAK.

Also the Monoprice 8323 (not available on Amazon) is known for very good sound and is cheaper than the Jbuds, they are known to be a bit bulky and hard to get a fit without after-market tips though.My recommendation is that you look around because even at this price point, there are better options out there",3.0,"Better than stock buds, but better option at this price",1330560000,"03 1, 2012"
A34LFSJHD41MGD,B000I68BD4,B. Barcellos,"[2, 3]","Good:Good sound and construction quality for the price. If you only want to spend $20, it's hard to do better than these.Generally pretty comfortable and can be worn for long periods of time, especially if you're the type who doesn't like an earbud to put things too deeply in your ear canal.Bad:Ear fit isn't very tight, unless you turn them upside down and shove them way into your ear. Even then, I had to use the rubber pads from a different  pair of buds for them to fit at all. The largest size pads that came with the buds were too small and pretty cheap. So while they are comfortable, people with larger ears may have a hard time keeping them in.They also do a poor job of blocking out sound. I normally only listen through one ear so that I can remain aware of my surroundings, so I need good isolation or I end up having to concentrate to hear. Even with both in, you can't really use these effectively on the subway or in the car with the window down unless you have the volume turned way up.The pads have fallen off more than once, which is unusual. Make sure you have spares, in case you lose one.Recommendation:Consider these if you1) are cheap2) like ""Y"" style headphones (I prefer J because of my one-ear listening)3) don't have large ear canalsBottom Line:I've been very critical of these in my review, but all in all I am pleased with them for listening to audiobooks, which is most of my listening.If you want a better fit, better pads, a case, and a volume control, consider theSkullcandy SC-SBB3.5 Smokin' Earbud Black, which were my former pair until they were eaten by my cat.They're the same price, and sound great once they've been broken in. Though I prefer the smokin buds to these, opinions are divided and you might not agree after reading all the reviews.The cheaper 'inked' buds by Skullcandy should be avoided however - within a week I had lost a pad and one of the phones had inexplicably died, and the fit isn't as good (but still better than the jbuds).",3.0,Good value,1212019200,"05 29, 2008"

Both being ""cheap"" earbuds, I felt they needed to be compared.I bought these because my V-MODAs were left at my father's place, which is approx. 4,000 miles or so from my place. I was without a pair of earbuds and really needed some, so I figured I would try these out since they were cheap but got great looking reviews. Sigh...FEEL:- The fit is somewhat comfortable, but for me, quite a bit less comfortable than the V-MODAs. The rubber buds are completely flimsy, almost like the consistency of a popped balloon.AMBIENT NOISE:- For these to be called ""Noise-Reducing"" is a complete joke. With these in my ears I could clearly hear the outside world both with music on and off. I tried different rubber covers, angles in my ears, etc. to no avail. The V-MODAs hands down win in this department. They actually almost feel like noise-cancelling buds.SOUND:- I don't know if it's because of the amount of air or ambient noise from the outside world, but the sound is very tinny, weak, and basically gives you a headache at mid-range volume levels. There is pretty much ZERO bass response. All the other sounds just mesh together. One plus, is they do have great volume boost, meaning I had to turn the volume down with these headphones to get the same volume level as with the V-MODAs.So, in conclusion, if you are looking at both these and the V-MODAs and don't know which ones to pick, get the V-MODAs.

I can also hear them with the sander on just about the same. I don't know how or why it works, but it seems to make all external sounds monotone while my music is on. The music is clear and I do not have to turn it loud to try and compensate for the external noise. It just seems to minimize the loud sounds around me while focusing the music into my ears. As far as durability... I have had these buds yanked out of my ears to hit the floor. They have been dropped. A fan actually fell on them once. They still work as they did out of the box. The Mic thing on it, I only used once and it seemed to work well enough for the people to hear my voice, but I had to hold it near my mouth as opposed to just speaking while it was hanging there. I love these, and when I destroy them I will buy another pair. Hope this review helps you make your decision.",5.0,Layman's Perspective,1380585600,"10 1, 2013"

The earbuds themselves are larger and bulkier than they need to be, and the actual covers on this are made of thicker inflexible silicone, so the earbuds fall out easily. On the bright side the covers don't come off as easily, but they're a pain to push back on if they do come off. The 3.5mm jack also isn't right-angled, which increases wear and tear on the cable.

So after my 3rd Coby gave out, I decided to try this item out.Look : First impressions, they look  almost identical to the Coby's but they have 2 more extra earpieces (small & large). The cord is a little flimsy (no complaints here since these are cheap) but the part where the cord connects to the jack looks very vulnerable and soft. If the earpieces get snagged (which happens with me a lot of times), I feel this part would give out. THe Coby's jack is L-shaped so if the wires get snagged, it takes a little stress off the jack/cord connection.Sound : Here is where I got disappointed. While the audio quality is good, its not as good as the Coby's. I tested both earphones side by side (The Coby's Right earpiece still works) and the difference is big. Jbuds did give a clear crisp sound but lacks the Bass sound which makes the sound fuller. Coby's has good Treble & Bass ranges and you can even hear the tiniest sound (from shakers or maracas or tambourines). IN some acoustic songs, the Jbuds lost the tiny background sounds (tambourines, etc as mentioned). I'm particular of those small background instruments since they give the song ""that feeling."" I tested both on acoustic, hiphop, RnB, rock, dance, trance songs and the Cobys sound better hands down. Dance tracks & HIphop where the bass is more prominent sounds better with the Cobys.Bottom line : If you want better sound (and can handle changing your earbuds every 3-6 months (The last one I have lasted 6mo. and all 3 Cobys lost sound on one side only) go for the COBYs. They sound good I still keep the old ones, cut-off the non-functioning side, & use it while sleeping. :) If you want an ok sound, go with the Jbuds since I read they have a 1-year warranty (without shipping charge) so your money is safe for a year.UPDATE: 6/10/2010My earbuds finally quit working so i emailed them about it. They sent me a replacement immediately & I got it in no time. Maybe the production has improved over the months but the new ones that i got sound waaaay better than the ones I've had.

I know nothing about ear bud ""burn in"" and if these ear buds benefit from a burn in period, or the percent of bass versus treble sounds you are getting.I am, however, a 5 hour per day iPod Nano 2nd Gen user who wanted a slight upgrade from the standard Apple buds, and these headphones deliver that, in my opinion.  I have used the black Jbuds for one month now.PROS:1. Sound isolation: the rubber ear pieces act like pretty good ear plugs and, therefore, channel all the music right into your ears.  I can operate my iPod at a lower volume and get as much sound channeled into my ears versus the old earbuds.  Plus I can run the lawn mower and not have to blast the music as loud to hear the music over the lawn mower noise.2. Versatile: three different size rubber ear pieces to help find a comfortable fit.3. Comfortable and small: the ear buds are smaller than I expected, and light and comfortable.  I can wear them for hours without getting pain in my ears from being ""stretched"" open, as happened with other ear buds I have tried.4. Good bass sound: I prefer heavier bass versus treble, and these seem to tilt toward the bass side.CONS:1. Left versus right: how much more would it cost JLabs to put a tiny white or red stripe around the cord where it meets one of the ear buds to differentiate right or left?  I got tired of looking for the small L or R printed on the buds and put a dab of white-out on the right hand cord where it joins the bud.  Now I can look down and quickly pick the correct bud for left or right!2. Cord tangles easily.  Other headphones I have owned have more spring in the cord to help prevent tangling.  If you put these in your pocket they get tangled about 50% of the time, in my experience.I would recommend these ear buds for someone looking for a reasonably priced upgrade from ear buds that ship standard with MP3 players.  I've owned a Dell Pocket DJ, SanDisk Sansa M230, and iPod Nano, and in each case the JBuds are a definite upgrade for me.",4.0,A non-audiophile review - comfortable sound isolating ear buds!,1187222400,"08 16, 2007"

Well they are the most comfortable ear buds I have found and since I use them just for audiobooks I do not care about sound quality. However I usually carry my small MP3 player in my pants pocket and when I bend over, sit or kneel in the yard it must put tension on the cord and they soon fail just near the plug. I end up with mono sound. The break occurs where it is not easily repairable so I toss them and go on to the next set. They are cheap enough that I may continue to purchase them although the last set only lasted a week until the wire failed.Edit on 5/4/2014I opened up my latest pair and noticed there was a warranty serial number and registration process. I registered the ear-buds and sure enough a few days later one of the wires broke. I went through the warranty process and discovered that it was quite simple and that I did not need to return the broken set. I had not registered previous sets because at this price point returning them would have been too much of an expense and hassle.

For Christmas 2008, my spouse got me a pair I'd put on my Amazon wishlist (the particular brand/style, which had cost around $19 is no longer there, too bad), which are the best earbuds I've ever had -- they had a solid-foam ear insert, that you rolled between your fingers for a few seconds to warm up (like the foam earplugs you use at a shooting range, or when diving - after you roll/warm them, you stick in your ears and they form to a custom fit), and they fit & sounded wonderful.

So ordered these.  They're comfortable for long-term use (but not as much as the pink jobbies), but don't block outside sound unless you're listening to something through them.

One of my pet peeves while working at a local coffee shop is all the background noise (especially the super-trendy music). I used to listen to my own music with some over-the-ear headphones, but I had to crank them up sometimes to block all the background noise. With these headphones, I can keep my music turned down nice and low while eliminating or reducing most background noise to a low murmur. It works great for what I wanted.As far as sound quality, the bass isn't too bad for a small headphone and all the mids and highs sound clean and crisp. The fidelity is so good on these headphones I can listen at very low volumes and the sound is still crisp.

A1P0JSFW184ZXJ,B000I68BD4,"Jen ""Geek Girl""","[1, 1]","I snatched up two sets of these ear buds at their current fraction of retail price as my husband and I are both avid music lovers and are rarely seen without our Archos media players. I was very hesitant at first given the reviews stating the ear buds failed after a fairly short period of time, but I figured for $10, you really can't go wrong. We have never had premium quality ear buds and both of us have been prone to ear soreness after extended use with our traditional ear buds. My husband especially suffered from this as he is always listening to music and podcasts throughout the day and at work and often uses music to help clear his mind to fall asleep at night. I had hoped that these JBuds would be great for both of us, and so far, I have not been disappointed.The included instructions state that you have to let the JBuds play music for an extended period of time to play at their full potential. If that's true, I am in luck because right out of the box they sound amazing. The quality is very crisp and clear yet very full. With my JBuds in, I am completely immersed and it's a beautiful thing. It sounds and feels as though the music is all around me. I am no audiophile, but music is a huge part of my life and these buds have multiplied my enjoyment of my music tenfold. Even when listening to podcasts, the voices are clear and it sounds as if the person talking is right in front of me. I know this is much owed to the ultra comfortable silicone ear buds which block out a surprising amount of external sound. The weather has been horrid here lately with harsh winds and I walked outside to take my pups in the back with my JBuds in and I didn't hear the howling wind at all. I have even been using these when gaming which has also been a treat. I love my Logitech G35 7.1-Channel Surround Sound Headset, but as it requires a restart of my game, I'm not always willing (or able) to restart on the fly to plug in my headset. In those situations, I plug in my JBuds and I'm completely immersed in my gaming world.As for comfort, as that was the driving force behind this purchase, they have not let me down. It was strange, at first, being that the way the JBuds fit as compared to standard ear buds is very different. The JBuds slide further into the ear than I am used to and it felt odd for the first five minutes or so. After that, I hardly noticed they were in. The soft silicone is fantastic for holding the buds gently in place but not putting any pressure whatsoever on the ear itself which was always our biggest problem. Standard ear buds have to be wedged into the ear and rely on that to stay in place, which not only leads to a less secure fit but soreness over time. The silicone ear buds fix both issues.My husband and I are both very pleased with this purchase and they have met and exceeded all my expectations for the price I paid. (I got two pairs for less than the half the price of one pair at retail!). I don't know if my review would be as glowing had I paid retail price. In truth, I probably would not have paid retail price for these just because I don't feel this type of product is worth that kind of money, but for what I paid, I am extremely happy and I'm even thinking about buying a few more sets for my nieces and nephew who aren't seen without their iPods.

Overall, I love the Jbuds and will purchase them again and have given several as gifts. The sound quality is great and is a definite value as an everyday pair of earphones for working out and such. I am no audiophile but even compared to my other pair of expensive Shure earphones, these are excellent. The only criticism I have is that I wish the cords were thicker and sturdier. On my last pair, one earphone no longer works and it is due to stress on the cord, I'm sure. At $20 a pair maybe I shouldn't expect too much perhaps. Honestly, with as great as these are in all other aspects, I don't think it is too much to ask for a stronger and thicker cord. Bravo to JLab for such a great overall value.

I put the buds in my ears and hit ""Play.""  Whoa!  The volume was more than loud, it was extremely loud.  So, I turned the volume down to about 2-3.  Now I use the earbuds to play music when I am mowing the lawn.  The JBuds DO reduce the noise of the lawnmower and I was able to hear the music clearly OVER the lawnmower.  It was a great experience to actually be able to hear the music while mowing the lawn.Needless to say that even though I bought these for my wife and they do not fit her, I am glad to have bought these earbuds.  I recommend them wholeheartedly to anyone who needs some noise reducing earbuds.They have faithful bass response and the highs are not muddy.

I think the sound is good (at least better than the other ones I've used... I'm currently listening to iheartradio on my computer and it sounds great.)They fit me fine. I am using the ear buds that came attached, but it came with two other pairs of ear buds (one larger, one smaller).Some other points that may only interest me but are positives:- The plug part is a bit thicker than most of the ear phones I've used before and feels well constructed.- Also the plug part is square. This is not really a big deal, but it's different and sets these JBLs apart.- The wire is also thicker and seems to tangle less than others I've had. A definite plus with the way that I use them.- The earphone pieces themselves have a nice comfortable tapered shape.I'm not a person who wants to spend a lot of money on earphones, but getting these for a good price has definitely made me appreciate the better design and construction of quality earphones.",5.0,Good Things to Say About These Earphones,1318032000,"10 8, 2011"

Cone,"[1, 2]","I've always had problems losing the little rubber ear tips that go on the Sony Fontopias and have found that I can order them separately online - they seem for fall off very easily for me but since my ear canals are smallish, they always fit well. The JBuds also fit very well, but *for me* the ear tips/rubber ear caps seem just a touch stiffer or slightly thicker than those on the Fontopias. The Fontopias were slightly more comfortable, but the JBuds are pretty darn close.I did but these because they were well priced and white, but Fontopias also come in white.Mmm, there is a noticeable difference. First, the cables are a bit stiffer and not as ""relaxed"" as the Fontopias - meaning, if you coil them up up crinkle them up in your bag andx then pull them out to wear, they retain that crinkled shape for a while where the Fontopias don't seem to do that. However, what I didn't like about the Fontopias was that the cables were coated with a sort of tackiness/stickiness that made untangling a challenge at times (if you didn't use the cord case that came with the ear buds).There is a nooticeable difference in sound. I get deeper sounds with the Fontopias, more bass. With the JBuds I hear crisper, lighter tones. I guess it depends on what you're listening to and what your preferences are. I like the JBuds now but that was after a couple of weeks of breaking into the new sound change.I had a problem with the white plastic coating pulling away from the ear bud at the base and exposing the wires. I think the Fontopias are probably built better overall.The jack that plugs into whatever device you're plugging into doesn't bend at a 90 degree angle like the Fontopias, where the bent part ends up parallel to the jack surface. It's bent more like 110 degrees so when you plug it in, the bent part isn't parallel to the device but sticks up a bit.

I prefer my Audio Technica QuietPoint ATH-ANC7Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling Headphonesover these but I got them for their small size.The ear buds are extremely prone to popping out of your ear canal if the cord is at all moved; which was not my case with the stock iPod ear buds. The input connector of the headphones seems to be the weakest hardware aspect as I found them to be scratchy if the body behind the jack is bent in anyway.Sound levels of the headphones feel muted and dull. I tried changing EQ on my iPod to various levels and I never felt the quality matched the AudioTechnica's. But then again they are not the most advanced and I knew that when I bough them.Pros: Completely blocks out all outside sounds. Small.

They seemed smaller than sleeves from other headphones (Sennheiser, Klipsch) both in diameter and length.

The cord doesn't straighten itself, however - it stays ""crumpled"" looking.Now despite all this, I'd still rate it 4 stars for being a great value.

When music is playing it's less discernible, but i think my ears still are annoyed. I have slightly sensitive hearing - as in, I can tell when a tv is on and the audio is on mute (it still emits a sound). So this slight hiss really bothers me.

I agree with other reviewers that calling them noise reducing is a bit much, but for the price, they do the job.  The rubber tips also help to keep the ear bud in your ear when you are running or moving around a lot; something the Apple ear buds don't do.The one negative for me was that the audio jack for the ear buds isn't compatabile with the plastic case I bought to protect my ipod.  The ear buds that came with the ipod have a narrow audio jack, while these have a much wider one.  This probably isn't a big concern for most people, but it may cause problems if you have other ipod accessories.Overall, if you don't want to pay alot and just want a everyday, ""knock-around"" set of ear buds, this is the product for you.

Talk formats are also excellent. The comfort is surprisingly good for an in-ear bud. For 20 dollars, this is a great substitute for the cheaper buds that come with most MP3 players.Update on 12-21-06: I've come to be more impressed with my JBuds over the last two weeks, marvelling at the bright, crisp, and yes, warm sound that comes out of these inexpensive buds. Perhaps, as I've read in some of the headphone information that is out there, that there is a ""breaking in"" period, which has something to do with loosening the tranducer. In any event, I'd have to give these JBuds another star.Second Update 10-8-07: My only complaint about the JBuds is that sleeping with them at night I will sometimes wake up and the bud will have fallen off. I can't secure the buds to my satisfaction; however, the JBuds are so comfortable I deal with this problem.Third Update 1-7-08: The sound is not quite as good as the slightly more expensive V-Moda; however, the JBuds are easier on my ears for long-term (I sleep with them on) listening. Also the JBuds have a longer extension and don't pull out of the radio or iPod headphone jack as easily as the V-Modas, so again on balance the JBuds are better.",4.0,Good Value at This Price Point,1165017600,"12 2, 2006"

At this rate I might as well buy a set of the Apple earbuds that will last me significantly longer and have better features.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Decent sound.

Most recently I tried the Coby headphones which I thought were fairly decent at the $5.00 price point.  As I am prone to losing headphones or having my children destroy them, I am simply unable to spend $60.00 a set like some of my friends.  These fit the bill and deliver more than the price indicates.Comfort is incredible.  You actually forget they are in since the design does not require you to force the bud into your ear. JBuds supplies a total of 3 sets of silicone ear buds to fit your ear.  Out of the box, they fit mine perfectly.  They hang down perfectly in the ear providing additional stability.Sound is impressive.  There was definately a break in period of about 5 hours (everyone reports different times).  I am not an audiophile but I could easily tell the difference between these and all the others.  Clarity is great and tones seem dead on.  But once again, I am not an audiophile and there are people who demand the absolute best in sound that would surely disagree. Note that some reviewers report distorted bass and compare the buds to Sennheiser's sold at $27.00 plus.  I did not find such distortion but do not have Sennheiser's to compare.From my perspective, there is no reason to buy any other headphone unless you are truly into the very best sound, which will send you to the $60.00 plus range.  However, it is important to remember that earbuds are simply that- earbuds.If you get these at the $10.00 price point, it is too good of an opportunity to pass up.

Luckily, they're cheap enough (for most of us) that it is worthwhile to purchase a pair to check out the comfort and fit.But what I was especially pleased by was the packaging.Earbuds wear out--at least for me, they do. I sometimes put 'em in a pocket and that wears out the connection right next to the plug, so I'm happy if they last six months. I just purchased to inexpensive pairs of earbuds here, theseJBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black)and someSony MDR-ED21LP Fontopia In-The-Ear Headphones.The JBuds came in a small zip-lock bag with a single piece of folded paperboard packaging. (Their text: ""JLab believes in being eco-friendly. This minimalistic packaging reduces waste."") Small enough that Amazon shipped it in a bubble-wrap envelope.The Sonys, in contrast, are in a hard blister pack--not quite as nasty as the impossible-to-cut plastic, but of the same ilk. The plastic is glued to paperboard backing, so the latter cannot be cleanly separated for recycling. Inside is more packaging paperboard and some inserts, as well as an astonishingly superfluous vinyl drawstring carrying case for the earbuds. I've already got two or three of those sitting in a drawer somewhere; I've never met anyone that takes off their earbuds and stows them in one of these things. I'd be quite interested to hear if anyone does--if you do, add a comment to my review. But I'm pretty sure that Sony is just being mindlessly wasteful, which isn't much of a surprise.But what really galled was that Sony's packaging was big enough that Amazon couldn't use a bubblepack envelope, and so shipped in a box, which was almost as big as a shoebox and mostly wasted space full of packaging material. Why Amazon couldn't combine the two packages I don't know, but Sony is still on the hook here for their sins.It helps that the JBuds are one-third cheaper than the Sonys, but both seem to change prices intermittently.So: if you're just grabbing a pair of work-a-day earbuds and all else turned out to be pretty much equal, go for the JBuds.

I am not that big on gadgets and music, so spending more than $10 on earphones was just not going to happen. The earphones fit well, with three pairs of adjustable pads to choose from to insert in your ears. Sound is good, and noise is considerably reduced, even on planes, which was my main reason for buying them. They do not reduce noise as much as higher cost earphones (I tested them against a pair from Sennheiser) nor do they reproduce sound as faithfully, but for my purposes, the difference was not worth the extra expense. Those who are more demanding on sound quality or noise cancellation may want to try one of the higher end JLab models.About two weeks ago the left channel gave out. When I emailed JLab Audio about it, they had me check the earphones on a couple of different pieces of equipment and run a track test on them (which is only fair). When this confirmed there was something wrong with the earphones, they immediately mailed out a replacement, which arrived within a week of my first email to them. If that were not enough, the replacement also carries a one year warranty! All for ten bucks.Although I was content with the earphones before, now I am a fan for good. It is just not that easy to find such outstanding customer service.

I bought mine to use mostly with a small Sony radio that I listen to every night before falling asleep. I've gone through countless pairs of earphones that lasted from a month to a year before being replaced. Most sets of ear buds I've used before have been uncomfortable but produced acceptable sound.The Jbuds are the most comfortable set I've worn to date. They fit my ears perfectly and fit deeply enough into the ear canal to stay put. Included with the buds are two additonal sets of rubber tips of different sizes for those who desire them.What about sound? I am by no means an audiophile so for my needs these earphones far exceed any requirements I may have.Just to test them out I hooked up the Jbuds into the Bose speakers hooked up to my computer. The sound reproduction is terrific and is as good or better than the sound from my Maxell headphones. Using the Jbuds I've noticed subtle background instrumentation that I hadn't detected before.No, these aren't state of the art sound reproducers, but for someone with modest needs and expectations the jbuds are a good choice.Durability - I use these buds every night. Sometimes they fall on the floor, or get tangled in knots, or get lost in the blankets, or even get pawed by Evie the bichon who tries to move them out of her way. They've lasted several months now unscathed and still sound as good as ever.One more thing - The directions in the little booklet that comes with the buds says that they need to be broken in, perhaps played continuously for a day.  Being a skeptic, I didn't believe that for a second. Yet, over time the sound through these buds does seem to have improved. The first time I tried them, the musical instruments sounded clear and crisp but the vocals sounded muted and distant. Now all is fine.

Well basically, it means that we're all trying to look for the cheapest product that will deliver the most bang.Now first off, I must say, DO NOT expect incredible results because these ear buds are dirt cheap and you really get what you pay for. These ear buds aren't terrible, but they aren't excellent either. Now we all know that the majority of the ear buds we get that comes in the package with the product we buy are typically never better than ear buds we actually buy. Well this is a true case for this product. To keep this short, these ear buds are definitely better than the stock ear buds I got but at the same time these ear buds do not meet my expectations for the level of clarity and depth of bass. There really is a reason why Shure can list their ear buds for over $[...] while these are under $[...] so with that, here's my pro(s) and con(s):Pro(s):- Dirt cheap- Cord has a good amount of length- Decent sound quality for the basic user or for last resort audio needs- Small- Comes with 2 additional sizes of silicone ear budsCon(s):- The inner ear bud, where the sound comes from does not have a moisture padding so if you have wet ears or just took a shower, do not use- If you have small ear holes, the packages includes smaller silicone buds BUT because the ear buds are quite big, they probably wouldn't fit inside your ear and stay- You have to read which side is left and which side is right- Not exactly easy to put on/replace the silicone ear buds on the buds itselfRecommendation(s)/Suggestion(s):- NoneBottom line is these ear buds are cheap and the best example for you get what you pay",4.0,"(4/5) Almost 2,000 Reviews!

I thought I have some deformed ear holes that I can never use ear phones. My right ear still hurts though, but not as bad as the iPod ear phones. I am using the smallest size ear plugs. They do reduce the noice a little bit if you are using the smallest plugs. But they reduce a lot more if you are using the medium or the large ones. Smallest ones are the ones that fit in my ears without me having to push hard so I guess they're my size. Like the other reviewer said, the problem is with bass and treble. I listen to a lot of electronic, techno, and house music, and I am missing the boom boom part. Well, life is not perfect. That's the reason for three stars. If you listen to pop, r&b;, hip-hop and other contemporary music, these ear phones sound bettter. I tried Gwen Stefanie and they sounded a lot better than my DJ's mix electronica. $20 is worth spending. Try them and you might like them base on what music you listen to. I'm keeping them nonetheless.Update a week later: Now I'm trying the medium size buds. I kinda have to push them a bit but the bass sounds a lot better if they're tightly fit in the ears. Also reduce a lot of outside noises. I said reduce, not cancle. They're noise reducing ear phone, not noise cancling ear phones (make no confusion). However, they tend to become a lot quieter indoors (therefore increasing the music volume). I have to lower the volume on iPod when I enter the library or anywhere inodoors that doesn't have a lot of noises. Similarly, I have to higher it a bit when I walk on the street. I have the iPod flip-open leather case right on my belt so turning the volume up is no big deal. I just thought you should know that. Also piano sounds vergood in these ear phones. Any classical music. I was at the bookstore with my iPod on shuffle mode once and there was this Beetoven track came on and I thought it was being played on the bookstore's ceiling speakers.

I couldn't hear anything from there. I tried to twist and bend the double-wire joint at the audio jack to get it to work, but it was just dead. On the brighter side, I filed a warranty claim on their website and got a new pair of JBuds (J1) for free in 3 days. They have changed the design a little since my last purchase. The wire used to be a double wire from the two earbuds all the way to the audio jack. In the new design, the two wires merge into one fat wire down the middle, and then goes and connects the jack. The jack is also a sturdier design now, and the wire-jack joint also looks sturdier. They have a slider on the two-wires leading to the buds to adjust your ""open length"". I was annoyed by the failure of the previous pair, but looking at their hassle-free warranty claim and prompt shipping of a better design, I don't have complaints (and the fact that the other pair is working fine since I bought it in Sept 2010).ORIGINAL:I wanted to get new earphones since I broke my Apple ones. Years ago I owned Sony Ericsson earbuds, I loved those. Couldn't find that quality since. When I read the reviews for these and saw the price (just 10 bucks), I thought why not. I simply love these.Pros:- Very comfortably fits into the ears, nice padding- Really good audio quality (bass is clearly audible unlike a lot of earphones)- You can keep the volume down to lesser damaging levels as these go inside the ear- Good cord length- Comes with extra padding-buds of a larger size- Gold tip 1/8"" audio jack- OK noise insulation (e.g., when you're riding the bus)- Insanely cheap for the qualityCons:- In the older design (c. Jan 2011) they had a double wire running from the earbuds all the way to the joint at the audio jack. It tends to be a flimsy connection, and can go bust (which it did for one of my pairs).

One big note, when you use any in ear-phones you need to make sure to use the right size tip and to insert them all the way in your ear canal, not doing so will make them sound flat, the bass is only appreciated when they are all the way in.

A21PJEIX2MIM1X,B000I68BD4,Val,"[1, 1]","I use these phones to listen to my MP3 player.  I bought them to replace two pairs of Coby noise isolating headphones I purchased elsewhere.  The Coby buds were less than five dollars a set, and for the price were really good buds.  BUT I've gone through two pairs in less than 5 months.  I also have a pair of much nicer Audio Technica noise cancelling earphones, ATH ANC3WH.The Cobys were much more comfortable and actually isolated more sound than the ATs cancelled.  I say this because I could listen to my Sansa with the volume at about 20%.  With the ATs, I usually listen at about 50% volume.  Not ideal for long term use.  I bought the ATs mainly for air travel. They are very uncomfortable in my right ear.  They are in ear canal phones, but part of the phones cover the cartilage that comes out of the center of the ear canal. (I have no idea what that part of the anatomy is called!  The ear ""uvula?"")  In any case, when I remove the ATs after wearing more than 30 minutes there is definite pain.  I don't experience it on my left ear, so I'm not sure what the deal is.  I'm disappointed in this as I spent FAR more on the ATs than either the Coby's or the JBuds.The ATs revealed more subtleties in the music than I ever noticed before.  Instruments I never noticed jumped out, background vocals shown through.  There is even one song I have which I never noticed a speaking voice in the background.  The first time I heard it with my ATs, the voice was so clear I nearly jumped out of my skin.  I was cleaning up my back patio and I thought someone had walked up behind me unbeknownst to me.  It startled the heck out of me.  When I saw no one had snuck into my backyard and onto my deck, LOL, I rewound the player and listened again.  Only then did I realize it was on the recording I was listening to!  That part of the ATs was incredible.  CRAZY!  I really appreciated the nuances revealed in my old music.  On the other hand, I found when using the ATs and my Sansa I started to get a lot of static.  I had been very happy with the player until I got the ATs.  I went back online and read several reviews that mentioned the Sansa was known for static at low volumes.  I started to dislike my Sansa and began looking for a better MP3 player that would benefit from my more $$ headphones.  I was not happy about having to shell out more money to enjoy listening to music again, but I figured I spent so much on the nicer phones I should invest in a nicer player.Now onto the JBuds.  They are most comfortable and come with three sizes of very soft silicone inserts.  I'm using the medium size wich fit very nicely in my ears.  I am no audiophile, but as far as I'm concerned the sound is great.  I hear subtle notes in the music that I never noticed on the Coby's much like the ATs.  Additionally, I'm again keeping my player volume lower, around 20-30%.  The even better news is with the JBuds there is NO STATIC when listening to my Sansa.  I am tHrIllEd!!!  I am back to LOVING my Sansa as I did before.  = )  But I do still have the new MP3 player coming.  Not happy about that....Oh well, maybe static was just an excuse to buy something new.If you are an average headphone user with basic needs, you can't go wrong with these phones.

I tried marking them with a fine-point Sharpie, but even permanent ink rubs off (great finish on these earbuds), so I cut a tiny piece off a clear band-aid and stuck it to one of them, and can now feel which is left or right without having to bother straining my eyes.Suggestions to manufacturer: Put a raised Braille-type dot on one, and two dots on the other.

They didn't sound real good and didn't come supplied with the ear bud pads in the box so they would just fall out of your ears. What's the deal with that? Next came the old Sony MDR 027 head phones from the closet. The Sony's have the old adjustable head bar so no more falling out of the ears now. They worked o.k., I guess, but in comparison these JBuds sound MUCH better than either of the previous ones. I'm now listening at half volume compared to about three quarters before and all sounds fine. I'm hearing parts of the music not audible before with the other two models. Crisper highs, great mid range, and responsive lows. Set up was fast too, just find the correct size ear bud pads out of the three different sized pairs supplied and your off and running. The JBuds actually stay in your ear. Wow what a concept. They are also very comfortable due to the fact I forgot they were in and started talking on the phone before noticing. The cord is just the right length for setting the ipod on a desk while still allowing plenty of movement or attaching it to a pocket. If you think you have a little too much just wrap some up with a bread tie. Better too much than not enough.
