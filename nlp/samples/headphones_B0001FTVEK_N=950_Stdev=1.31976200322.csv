"12 22, 2005","[13, 14]",5.0,Outstanding,B0001FTVEK,"&#34;Sam&#34; Twain ""Samuca""",AXKI4FBLRF42D,"Before ordering this headphone I read very carefully previous reviews. The reviews I read were helpful, well written and I was stimulated to write my own. There were basically two groups of reviews, one being highly complimentary of the RS-120 and the other group complained about noise, hiss, and comfort. My own review falls in the first group. However I must say that noise and hiss can happen in some environments and are not necessarily a problem with the headphone. In fact, it is easy for me to induce noise/hiss when I approach the motor of the refrigerator or I approach the emitter from other electronic equipment. Noise/hiss are nightmares for engineers and sometimes there is not much that we can do to eliminate these problems in the immediate physical world that surrounds us. We need to troubleshoot to get the best location of the emitter in order to enjoy this remarkable set of headphones. And the price at Amazon was a real bargain.",1135209600

"07 19, 2008","[0, 0]",5.0,Excellent for the price,B0001FTVEK,718tech,A1HRECPV2Q79BG,"These headphones do exactly what they're supposed to - they free you from a cord, comfortably and efficiently. Just make sure to fully charge the batteries before you use them. If you use them with the low charge the batteries have out of the box, you'll think something is wrong. You need to charge them for 24 hours before the first use.Once fully charged, the performance is quite good. In my smallish apartment in NY, which has a lot of interference sources, I get a very good signal in every room with little to no noise. Sound quality is not as good as audiophile corded headphones (I have Grados for that), but for TV watching while my wife's asleep or casual music listening the RS120 is just the ticket, and the price is right.",1216425600

I recommended it to a friend, however, and he loves it.  If I do decide to get another pair of headphones, however, I will probably invest a little more, to hopefully be better satisfied.  What is disappointing is: Reception is spotty, almost requiring  its use to be within a relatively short distance from the transmitter, the fit on the head is not very good and restricts much activity, and there is very little (almost no) restriction of other sounds.

"06 18, 2008","[0, 0]",4.0,So far so good,B0001FTVEK,A. Bothel,AF3G5GJFCBJ65,"I have been wanting to switch to wireless headphones for a long time, mostly because of the fact that I always get wrapped up in the cords or my pets mess with the cord. I was skeptical to switch because of quality and price. However, after reading a lot of reviews, I decided to try these out. I am pleased with them so far. They have great range with little to no loss of quality in and around my house.The ONLY real negative thing I have seen (heard rather) is the Automatic Gain Control which to my knowledge, can't be turned off. If you listen to music with sudden changes, such as movie soundtracks or classical, every time you get a sudden noise, such as drums, cymbal, etc, the Automatic Gain Control lowers to volume to compensate for the sudden increase in volume, or so it thinks. This can make your music somewhat inconsistent, which can be annoying. I would imagine with more constant sounding music, it would be a non-issue though.That being said, I am still happy with my purchase, and would recommend them to someone looking to get away from a corded set.",1213747200
"01 21, 2012","[1, 1]",4.0,Good headphones but won't work for everyone!,B0001FTVEK,AC,ASVZC9DBNE92O,"I bought this headphones as a gift for my father so he can listen freely while moving around the house. Before giving it to him, i decided to try it in my house first. Plus, I new that they have to be charged for 24 hours (or 12 hours, I can't remember) before the first use, so I figured it will be better to give it as a gift when they are ready to go!First, I was very very disappointed. No matter what I did, I heard loud static noise, which was very periodic, and sounded like knocking (~ 60 knocks/sec). I tried all three channels on the base, I turned off my PC, router, every possible source of noise. I went to the basement, connected it to PC...and noise was still there. It was unbearable. Then, I realized that it could be the baby monitor. I have a child and the base of the monitor is always turned ON and it turned out that it always transmits, no matter whether the monitor itself is ON. The moment I turned off the base, the noise was gone and the sound in headphones was loud and clear. For me, this headphones would not work. I need the baby monitor. I cannot unplug it to listen to the music. However, if I did not use it, the headphones were great!I gave it to my father, and I was glad to learn that neither his house, nor his neighbors, have a noise source that interfere with his headphones. He is extremely happy. He wears them for many hours every day, around his apartment, lays down on the couch, cook with them, you name it. Today, he went to the gym in his building, which is 2 stores down from him (but right under), and could hear very well (even while traveling in the elevator). Even though he claims that he does not hear any static, it is possible that due to his hearing, he may not pick up all the noise..but who knows...The bottom line - it could be a waist of money if you have a wireless device in your home that just happen to work on the same frequency as the headphone (in my case it was a particular model of the baby monitor), or it can be a treasure, and let you truly disconnect and go around and enjoy you music, even outside of your apartment in the gym, like in the case of my father, all noise free! You have to give it a try and see.",1327104000

I'm a veteran, with a high-frequency hearing loss, and not being able to hear all the dialog on TV shows, finally got to the point where I wanted to do something about it. I don't have a problem with DVD's, or Blu-Ray, as I can put on sub-titles. Anyway, these headphones have been a boon to me. I had been using earbuds, plugged into a curly cord, plugged into my stereo receiver, but dealing with the cord got to be annoying. Now that I've gotten used to the wireless, instead of just wearing them for my favorite shows, I use them all the time. Part of getting used to them, meant dealing with the weight, as these obviously are heavier than ear buds, and making sure that they're placed on the cradle properly, so that they will always be charged when you use them.",1396742400

"10 30, 2013","[2, 2]",5.0,Completely Satisfied,B0001FTVEK,A. Hearn,A3JM1TJILHPS7G,"I've had my Sennheiser headphones about 6 years and been completely satisfied with them. Just now, after much use, the plastic headband has cracked and I'm looking for replacements. Guess what I'm going to buy......you guessed it, another of the same make and model.I've found them to be extremely comfortable to wear, even when watching long movies on TV (my primary use). I use them particularly to watch TV shows in which I need help with hearing high frequencies, particularly women's voices. High frequency hearing deficiency is common with older folks like myself. These headphones have been a lifesaver in that respect.I also use them when watching high-quality musical programs. The outstanding music reproduction and stereo/surround quality of these headphones is amazing. Frequency response seems well balanced and doesn't have the high boom-boom bass of many modern headphones targeted to kids.Another use is that my wife likes to watch TV at low sound volume. I prefer higher volume. With the headphones we can each have it our way.I also like the fact that I can be watching a TV program and be able to get up and get a snack or take a bathroom break in the middle of a show and not miss any dialog. Yes, the further you get away from the sending unit, the more likely that the signal will break up but that's to be expected.In the 6 years I've owned them, I've only replaced the rechargeable batteries once, and that was simply a preventative measure, not a necessary one. I don't know how much useage is possible on a single charge because I've never had them expire. I normally use them two or three times and then put them back on the charger.I'm buying another pair and look forward to another 6 years or more of use.",1383091200
"12 4, 2012","[0, 0]",3.0,How much will static annoy you?,B0001FTVEK,AJ Hawks,A3L7HPEMZWF5YD,"I've had these for several years, and they ended up being a backup pair of headphones, rarely my primary set. I just decided to order some Sennheiser MM 400's to replace them though.PROS:* Good range, through walls, etc. They're in the 900MHz band, which does provide long range signal.* Comfortable fit* Good sound usually* Long battery life* Base station charges internal battery. I've never had to replace the battery.CONS:* 900MHz range, analog signal. It's like listening to AM radio. It crackles, if you shift your head the wrong way and hit some interference from something else, you hear a buzz, or it cuts out.* When there's no sound for a few minutes, the base station turns off and you get a loud blast of static in your ears. This happens a lot when I forget I'm wearing them and the playlist ends.* I don't like needing a powered base station for headphones. Takes up an outlet and desk space.* Constantly fiddling with the tuning nob to find the right frequency.I decided to go with the MM 400's for the replacement set, since they are bluetooth and can pair to my phone or computer, plus they have an audio cable port for airplanes, older sound sources, etc. They charge over USB so no base station. And they won't have the reception issues.",1354579200

"05 28, 2010","[0, 0]",5.0,Very Pleased,B0001FTVEK,Alan,A2RK96D6IJJWAE,"I bought these headphones for my father, who is in a nursing home and is functionally blind. He loves to listen to NPR and PRN and also books-on-tape. I needed a headphone that was wireless, with good sound quality, good range and a very easy charging dock. For all of these qualities the headphones delivered without disappointment! With Dad's impaired vision and some slight dementia, he is still able to get the headphones on and off without incident, and the way the charging is accomplished through the wire hoop that acts as a stand/holder for the headphones was pure genius on the part of Sennheiser!The range is good enough that he can not only listen anywhere in his room, but even as he roams the halls and the dining room! There are controls right on each headphone earpad , one for on/off and the other for volume control, which Dad has a little trouble with, but I am sure were designed to be discrete for the average user. It took a little training to get Dad to be able to find and use those switches.Dad gets daily use out of these headphones and they have brought much enjoyment to his life.Our only concerns were about accommodating his needs. The switches on the headphones are a little difficult for older, stiffer fingers, and the two LEDs on the Base unit are too small for him to see easily. But this was never designed to be a tool for the visually impaired so it's hard to really fault there.The sound quality surprised me, and I may well buy another pair for home use for myself!",1275004800

Recommendation - read instructions carefully.The sound quality is very good. As previous folks have mentioned - to reduce the static/hiss - you need to increase the input power to the phones and then reduce the volume using the control on the headphones.Phones are comfortable and easy to use once setup correctly.I bought an extra set of phones and they both work well of the same RF transmitter.Wish I had bought these a long time ago.

Sound is good - Very good - when it actually works...Now let me elaborate on that, the problem I find is it has a &#34;tune&#34; dial and sometimes (most times) you hear interference, it is sort of the price you pay for a wireless product with an FM transmitter.  Now the bad part, is you can be listening to music and you decide to browse for songs, and if you are like me you like good music with good volume, so you are browsing your folders and BAM a loud noise from the deepest darkest location of FM Hell will leave you deaf ... or at least will attempt to.  See in accordance to FC regulations Sennheiser has to shut down the transmission when it is not being used, the sad part is you will hear a loud SHHHHHHH every time it decided to shut down, and it will happen often, there is no way to turn it off, fix it nothing.. it is what it is, the only solution I have found to this is I downloaded a program that does a random sound every 40 secs or so, and it re establishes the link so the death SHHH sound doesn't get me.So yeah.. oh and Sound is good... when it works",1378425600

This company has a great reputation for sound quality but the low price caused me to have doubts.The sound quality would be acceptable if the ""hiss"" from the transmitted sound were not so pronounced.  The tuning adjustment is of some help but to tune all of the ""hiss"" out so degrades the audio quality that the device is unusable.It appears that if the audio input levels are even slightly low the ""hiss"" is very loud and annoying.  Turning the input level up does help but that defeats the purpose of the earphones (having a silent TV).  Using the audio out of a receiver with a standardized-fixed level is inadequate to control the RF ""hiss"".The fit and comfort of the headset is acceptable but don't expect to wear the headphones for an extended period.Overall the RS 120 would be a good buy but the annoying hiss detracts to the extent that I would not recommend this unit until the manufacturer addresses the noise level at low signal inputs.It will pay you, I think, to look to a different manufacturer or spent a little more to purchase a better quality product from Sennheiser.",1255564800

For the price, they deliver a very good sound.  I'm not going to go into the sound so much, as there are plenty of reviews for that, but a few things I did find were that I concur with other reviewers that there is some interference/static.  I don't have to go very far in my house to start hearing slight static noises, especially if I go into another room.  Normally I wear these if I'm doing housework, or vacuuming, and walking around causes some annoying static.  Not enough to ruin the listening experience, but more than I want.  Also, these are uncomfortable on my head.  The ear cups are flat, not cupped, and when they are on my ears, part of it presses against my jawbone near my ear, causing discomfort after just a few minutes of use.  I was going to return them for this problem, but I find that if I turn them around, the shape of them holds them off my jawbone.  It looks funny, and there the sound is not as rich as if they were fully cupped on my ears, but it's the only way I can wear them comfortably.  Even still, as with most headphones I've found, they get uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing (they are not very light).Overall, I bought these for the wireless ability, and they work very well for that (even with some static issues).

I swapped them around and discovered each pair worked fine in the bedroom, but not in the living room.

Everything about them is great, so I'll just mention a couple of specially favorite features:* The ""coat hanger"" on the base unit looks a little odd but you'll find that you can drop the headphones onto it and start them recharging. There is no need to place them carefully or jiggle them around to make an electrical contact for charging, as most other products require.* The three position channel selector on the base/transmitter is great, allowing you to find the best, interference-free signal, but better still is the fine-tuning control on the headphones themselves (that's in addition the volume control). If, while listening, you wander into an area of the building where the signal drops, loses quality, or picks up interference, you can use this fine-tuning control to bring back the best quality listening, often without needing to adjust the volume control.My only (very small) criticism is that the headphones seem to be made for someone with a somewhat larger head than mine. I think I'm a fairly typical adult male, and yet I need to wear these headphones with the headband adjusted to the smallest, tightest setting. Even so, when tilting my head forward and downward its necessary to grasp the headphones to prevent them falling off. In most circumstances, the headphones fit very comfortably, and a little care when moving around is a small price for the brilliant audio quality, but for children or smaller-headed adults, this could be a problem.",1328832000

Get a cheaper set of wireless headphones that have the same quality, or just pay a bit more for something a lot better. That is up to you to decide.",1343692800

"03 3, 2012","[3, 3]",5.0,PROBLEM? SWITCH RADIOS!!! Excellent headsets!!!,B0001FTVEK,Amazon Customer,A33ECPWPO5YMBK,"4-24-13I now have 3 of these headsets and love them!  Got my last one in January 2013.If your earphones don't work properly SWITCH radios!!!  I have two ratherexpensive radios of the same brand. When I got my second headset (my first is onmy TV) I connected it to one of my radios and it would not work properly.  Itried everything and nothing worked.  The headset would work for about 5 minutesand then cut out and nothing I could do would get it working again.I was about ready to send this headset back but decided I would try it on myother radio (remember, same brand).  It worked GREAT and I have not had aproblem with it since (it has been several months since I switched radios).  Iuse the headset when I am out in the yard or doing housework going from room toroom.So, before you think the headset is defective, try it on another radio and youmight find that the headset works fine.  That the problem was that the radiojack on the first radio just did not properly accept the headset connection.Also, remember that the headset is designed to turn itself off if there is noradio sound for a period of time in order to save batteries.----------prior review--------I have tried several different brands of headphones and these are by far thebest.  In fact, when I got mine I connected them to receive my radio and was soimpressed that immediately ordered a second set so I could connect them to mytelevision.  The headphones are so light that I put them on and just leave themon as I work inside and outside the house.  The sound is excellent (I listen totalk radio), very smooth - not irritating as with some headphones.  I wanted twosets so when I switched from listening to a tv program to a radio program, I donot have to reconnect them.  It takes about 5 minutes to connect them.  Let theheadphones charge for 24 hours and then enjoy!!!  When you put the earphonesback on the charging stand they immediately make the connection and startcharging.  There is no fumbling around with trying to get them to connect to thecharging stand as when you place the headset on the stand it automatically slipsonto the connection.  Do not let the lights on the charging stand fake youout...they seem to light up when they want to.  When you put the headset on thestand the red light will come on.  The green light seems to do whatever it wantsbut it works.  When you first connect the charging stand to the electricity thegreen light may or may not come on but it is ready to charge the headset.  Wantto thank the person whose recommendation said he could do his neighbors yardacross the street and hear his program as I wanted a set that would let me do myyard work and I have a big yard.

"09 24, 2011","[6, 7]",2.0,I honestly cannot recommend them,B0001FTVEK,Amazon Customer,A2B91FKISTN0Q0,"When shopping around for wireless headphones, one of the biggest complaints was the range of signal. Before I wrote this review I wanted to test that. I walked upstairs, passed brick, wood, tile, a thick glass sliding door and walked all the way to the far corner our double lot property before I heard any static start to ease in. Realistically, I could mow the lawn or shovel snow wearing these and that's not even the reason I bought them! And for 50 bucks!I noticed a bit of static when I first put them on and thought, ""Oh, well there's that static everyone's talking about."" Then I turned on some music, and nearly blew my eardrums out. The static only exists when the volume is deafening. I ran a test. I turned the headphones to the exact point where the static disappears. When I turned on my music, it was still much louder than I would probably ever listen to it. Just make sure you turn your computer or TV all the way up, and use the volume knob on the headphones to turn it down to minimize any static.The volume and the frequency knobs are right next to each other and feel identical, so unless you've mastered the feel of the headphones, you'll probably have to double check which knob you're touching. It wouldn't have taken much effort, time, or thought to put one of the knobs on the other headphone or make one smaller or different in texture, or just space them farther apart. It's a stupid design flaw, and it wouldn't really matter if it weren't so easy to have fixed. It doesn't change my idea of the headphones. It just makes me think someone dropped the ball at Sennheiser.They are EXTREMELY comfortable. Easily the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. The pads are a soft fuzzy material so you don't get sweaty-leather-ear. They feel like extremely comfortable ear-muffs. They're just heavy enough to feel nice and sturdy on your head. The earphones themselves are large and flat against your ear, but they don't squeeze against your ears and make them sore, even after 10 hours of use. If there is any complaint about the form of them, sometimes I feel like they could fall off. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with these, and I plan on linking everyone at work to this amazon page.UPDATE:After using the headphones for a few days at work, I have run into some problems. First and most importantly, these do not keep the sound in at all. I was listening to an audiobook at a reasonable volume and the coworkers around me could hear it clearly. This is a huge problem if you're a person who doesn't want to disturb others. Listening to music with distinct sounds, like hi-hats or high-pitched instruments can be heard by those around you very clearly.Secondly, there is an issue with the auto-off feature. If no sound enters the headphones for about a minute or two, the signal is cut off and static fills the headphones. The solution is to develop a couple habits. Whenever you are not listening to audio, shut the headphones off. And if you forget and the headphones auto-shut off, you must turn them off until you plan on listening to audio again. If you just turn the audio back on when the static is playing, the headphones will take a second turn on. It's annoying, and a maddeningly stupid design choice, but not entirely debilitating.Thirdly, they do not keep sound out at all. Unless I blare my music, everything in the office can be heard as clearly as if nothing was on my ears at all. This may be a selling point for some people who dislike being deaf to outside sound. Nobody will have to try to get your attention twice. You'll hear them the first time.I changed my rating from 5 to 4 stars during this update.UPDATE: 10.20.2011The volume knob grows more annoying as time goes on. Once you're used to the headphones, you want to notice them less, and just hear the audio, but when you have to take your right hand off of the mouse in order to change the volume, this grows annoying, I often reach up with my left hand to change the volume just because it would feel so much more natural that way. Left handers have nothing to worry about. Another, easily fixed, stupid design choice by Sennheiser.The problem with the headphones being loose and falling off has proved to be more of a factor than I originally thought. I often have to hold onto the headphones when picking something up or if I plan to move quickly. It seems more and more like these headphones were not made with computer use in mind. Watching movies is a more stationary activity and would probably be better suited to these headphones.During this update I have changed my rating from 4 to 3 stars.UPDATE: 11.23.2011This will be my final update, because I am replacing these headphones with a usable pair. The sound blasts outward from the headphones louder than they do inside them. I literally cannot listen to them at work at even 10% volume without workmates asking me to turn them down. On the sides of the headphones, it looks as if there are actual speakers projecting out. This, coupled with the fact that they do not cancel a single decibel of sound, makes them useless as a pair of headphones. They might as well be a set of desktop speakers that you wear on your head.I have lowered my rating to 2 stars this update.",1316822400

The flat ear pieces lay flat, rather than hooking around the ears, so they just slide off your ears when you tilt your head forward or back.  And the bar that rests on the top of your head is horrible also... even on it's tightest setting it is loose on a medium-sized head, and the padding provides no friction.

We bought these over 6 months ago because my wife and I enjoyed watching TV together in the living room after our kids went to sleep at night but our daughters room and the living room are separated only by a non-insulated interior wall and she is a light sleeper so we had to keep the volume at such a low level that we could barely hear any of the dialogue.  Once I started looking for wireless headphones, I clicked over to amazon.com (as I usually do) and started my search.  Instantly, I was drawn to these because of the great reviews, good name brand recognition, ease of charging, expandability, etc and I must say I'm glad I picked them up.  We got two sets with the charging cradles as we keep one of the cradles/transmitters in the living room and one in our bedroom since each can use separate frequencies.  Sound quality and range are both very good in my opinion, but I wasn't looking for any thing with crystal clear sound.  In sound quality, these can't compare to my wired noise-cancelling head phones, but they do their job exceedingly well.  If I try hard enough, I can usually pick up a very faint hisss typically associated with wireless devices such as these and on occasion I'll experience a short burst of static (less than a second), potentially due to the countless other wireless devices in my home but it's never bothered me enough to look into it.  Despite the fact that most audiophiles probably wont be satisfied with the sound quality (not saying it's bad by any means, but it is wireless afterall) I would still HIGHLY recommend these headphones to anybody in the market for them.5 starts because these were exactly what I was looking for and do the exact job I expected them to do.",1293062400

If you keep the TV volume down, then crank up the headset volume, you're gonna get alot of noise.I am using the RS120 with a cheap color TV and DirecTV standard def box. The base station plugs into a headphone port on the TV. See comment above on setting the volume levels, before you conclude that the headphones are noisy.I did have to charge overnight before the headphones were usable out of the box. Once charged, I used them very successfully for the first time last nite.  The sound quality is good, with a very light hiss of background noise. The background noise is not annoying and is way down in level, but is good since it tells you that you the headphones are on and it's the TV program that might be silent for the momentThe comfort is nice, but if you're sitting in bed with your head against a pillow, then you may find that the pillow sort of pushes the headphone cups away from  your ears.

He is not a huge fan of mine, either. I finally bought these and hooked them up to the TV and our marriage has never been better.I did buy some cheaper wireless headphones at one point from another company (not Amazon or Sennheiser) and these are so much better quality. I think wireless headphones are the type of thing where you really want to have a good quality item. The cheap ones had tons of static and never really worked well. These are great. I did follow the advice of another Amazon reviewer who suggested turning the TV volume way up and the volume on the headphones down a bit.The one caution I would share is- if you have the headphones powered on, but the TV is off, or paused, and no sound is coming out of it for a couple of minutes, the headphones lose their signal and start playing super loud static. So if you need to pause your DVR to take a short break, don't absentmindedly walk around with the headphones on or you will get a rude awakening.

"02 8, 2012","[0, 0]",2.0,Why such good reviews?????,B0001FTVEK,Anonymous,A2GSTGJBMF5SAS,"Background:I have had a set of Sony MDR-RF970RK Wireless Stereo Headphones for about a year now.  I wanted to get another set for my wife, and being the research nerd that I am, I found these Sennheiser's reviewed higher the the Sony, so I gave it shot.  Big let down!Pros:- the only thing that could be considered good (depending on your perspective) about these vs the sony is the manual on/off switch.  The Sony has a very well engineered auto switch that comes on every time the headphones are on your head.  There is a very sensitive elastic band built into the head piece that senses even the slightest amount of pressure.  In the most awkward of positions if they are being pushed off your head because you are laying on a pillow or something, they can sometimes turn off and you have to re-adjust them.  But 99% of the time it's a non issue and very convenient to have them automatically turn on and off.  With these Sennheiser's you can turn them on with the switch manually - just don't forget to turn them off and run the battery dead!  Something you don't need to worry about with the sony.Cons:- WAAAAY less comfortable than the sony!  The sony ear pieces are so much softer and more plush!  No contest!  These feel like hard cheap vinyl instead of soft plush material like the sony.- you have to ""tune"" them with a dial, otherwise you will hear static.  Maybe this comes in useful under extreme distances (which is not something I use it for).  For the majority of situations this unnecessary and just one more thing to have to adjust.  The sony just automatically tunes it's self (just fine).- Charging sucks compared to the sony!  The sony has a nice little groove that ""locks"" the headphones in place.  Just drop them in the cradle.  They charge like apple computers with no physical connection.  This Sennheiser has to be ""aligned"" on 2 metal rods and you need to make sure it is getting good metal/metal contact.  It's totally jenky after getting used to the sony.  I literally couldn't believe it when I first went to charge them.Overall these are not even in the same league as the sony??  WTF?

Whenever you tune to the signal, you can hear everything just fine. Unless you set the volume all the way high you do not hear a hissing noise. The only downside to these headphones are sometimes they get cutoff when someone near you is using some device with the same frequency. Although that's not common, if you're looking for a good pair of wireless headphones that aren't too expensive, these are the way to go. But nothing beats a wired connection, so unless you absolutely need wireless, I would recommend wired headphones.",1202601600

If you are in any way an audiophile these are not the headphones for you.  If you must have or really want a pair of wireless headphones these are the pair for you.  I tried these headphones with other wireless devices around and with no wireless devices around and I got the same results in both situations.  There is definitely a hiss in the background while you listen to these.  If you are watching a movie or TV it fine because the audio is really busy and so you don't notice the hiss but if you are listening to an audio book you definitely notice the hiss.  You can also hear the hiss when your are listening to music.  The sound quality is good but not great.  The bass is missing the mid's and trebles are OK.  I compared them side by side with other Sennheiser wired headphones and the sound is drastically better with wired headphones.  My final notes are if you absolutely must have wireless these are alright but if good quality sound is what you can't live without check out Sennheisers wonderful selection of wired headphones.,1110585600

I thought it was broken and being that I hate returns, I cursed my luck - only to find that the earpads were detachable. *whew*!(i) CONS: The setup is easy, though the included manual isn't really the best. I had it connected via digital-to-audio Gefen converter to my HDTV.I wasn't really sure when the green light on the transmitter is supposed to come 'on', and even now I am not completely certain. This is why I am not pleased with the manual. My setup had a faulty Toslink cable and the green light wouldn't light up - because of which I thought there was something wrong with the transmitter. Trial and error nailed down the problem to the faulty Toslink cable, which I have since replaced and everything is working as it should be. A little more clarity in the manual (instead of printing it in 25 languages, half of which no one would really care about) would have been appreciated.(ii) The included batteries are rechargeable (NiMH) no name 600mAh AAA batteries - are you kidding me ?! 600mAh ?! I would hard pressed to find 600mAh batteries fron any acceptable brand right now in the market. I don't expect them to last too long so I have gone ahead and purchased a set of 1000mAh batteries from Tenergy(iii) Which design wiz decided to place the volume control and the tuning control next to each other on the right earpad ?! I mean a little user testing would have shown up this glaring error! I am having a headache thinking of the number of times I will use one of these controls mistaking it for the other....(iii) PROS: The audio quality across the entire range - from bass to mids to high, is definitely good - not audiophile quality mind you but then I wouldn't expect that at this price range. It does what it is supposed to do and does a very good job of it. Directional audio is well captured - useful while gaming or for immersion in video(I dont know if this is a TV parameter or a headphone parameter but I am mentioning it just in case..)(iv)I live in a small condo so I do not walk around much using this but whatever little walking I did do, didn't produce any interference - barring the one instance when I could hear someone's phone conversation!!

The headphone acoustics isn't all that good in my opinion. I'm really dissatisfied that one spot right in the middle of my lazy-boy that causes the sound to become distorted,  with a lot of white noise -- just a tilt or movement of the head either left or right. The height of the transmitter or moving it away from the TV location does not make any difference as does resetting to one of the other two channels on the transmitter.An apparent problem is when the input signal to its transmitter is too low, you mute the TV, pause the VCR, or a scenes is being shown that has a long silence, the base unit will shut down and a very loud static will blast your eardrums and that really hurts. This could be a big drawback if it depend on the TV volume alone since the purpose of using them in the first place is to turn the volume down. It does shut down on occasion for no apparent reason.On occasions, as with many wireless products, there is occasionalinterference and I have received the next door neighbor talking on their phone which is a cordless but I don't know their frequency. Our 800mh phone does not interfere and there is no other wireless items round except garage door opener devices.The headset fits pretty well and is comfortable for extended wear but is slightly larger than I like for my head size 7. It certainly tends to slip around to much or fall off when nodding your head. They could have improve the ear pieces by cupping them so they fit around the ears instead of the fitted flat covers used.Too much interference for a $70 device in my opinion.Update 10/18/09: Had to use the manufacturer warranty on 9/21/09 since the charging system failed. Just received today a confirmation that the unit is being replaced and that Seenheiser is mailing a new replacement.First edit: Everything above still stands after receiving my replacement. But, the reception and sound tracking is really, really better than the first set. I took the covers and foam rubber off the ear pieces and cut out a circle from the foam rubber so that the phone pieces more or less fit around the ears. After replacing the covers and the foam rubber circles the headset fits a lot better and doesn't fall off to often. Now why couldn't they think of that.Update 5/30/12: The two paragraphs above with stood the time until today when the receiver base GREEN light no longer lights when attached to its source nor is there any sound in the headphones other than white noise.

Based on the reviews, I thought this might be a good fit. I tried to get these to work, but they just didn't. There was constant cracking and humming. I tried everything to limit it, but nothing helped. I moved the receiver, I spent a lot of time tuning, I spent time adjusting the source....nothing produced the sound quality others have mentioned. In addition to that, even with the volume at 100 on the source AV, the headphones did not produce a loud enough sound to completely block out the sound of the treadmill (or allow me to get into the workout). If you can figure out how to eliminate the hissing and cracking, these might be OK for use in bed. Other than that, I don't see a benefit. Thumbs down!",1333497600
"01 29, 2009","[0, 0]",4.0,"Sound great, easy set-up, comfortable",B0001FTVEK,Bill Staley,AUWS4WEQ3GS53,"Bought these for an 84-year-old to hear the TV.  She has not tried them yet.  I attached them to my iPod and they sound great to my 56-year-old ears.  Comfortable, although (as many reviewers have noted) when you bend down you need to hold them on or slide the top to the back of your head. Super easy to set up.  Built-in male red and white RCA plugs, with extensions provided for 1/8th inch iPod style and old-school 1/4 inch guitar-amp style plugs.The headphones do need to be tuned to the signal from the base station, which is the reason for 4 stars, not 5.  For 5 years I had 4 IR earphones in a Suburban for the DVD-game player.  Little kids had nothing but problems with the tuners on the headphones.  They would try to change the volume but change the tuner and ""lose the station"" instead, then whine in frustration, but there was nothing I could do when I was driving.  (OK, I'm the one whining now.)  I am concerned that the 84-year-old will have the same problem.  Seems to me this is OK technology for engineers, but not for very old or young people.  It would be better to set it at a particular channel than to have the tuner infinitely variable and very, very easy to change.  (PS  I ended up taping the tuner in the Suburban.  Then I stopped using the DVD player unless someone was sitting back there who could manage the tuner situation.  And change the DVD when a movie ended.  The little kids would beg for the DVD player, but when there was no ""manager"" I played CDs of Laura Ingalls and Beverly Cleary stories and that worked.)That said, the RS120 headphones tuned very easily for me with no background noise walking from room to room.  I will let you know how they work for the 84-year-old.*******A month later:Well, she says they changed her life.  Best addition to her life since her dog.  She does not need to use the captions on the TV anymore.  She got a new DVD player so she can watch movies, too.  (The old player was broken, but she did not care because she could not hear it.)  She can watch TV and DVDs in the wee small hours without waking the whole neighborhood.  The earphones are a little wobbly in the holder/charger and have to be set just so or they won't charge, but this does not bother her.  There is a bright red LED light that tells you they are set in there correctly so they can charge.  She has no issues with the amount of time she can use them between charges. I don't think she has ever run out of charge.  We tuned them to the base station and put Scotch tape on the tuner wheel when we set them up for her.  She has no issues with tuning them.

I've used this brand before and bought a pair from Amazon a few years a ago for my Grandmother. I'm not sure what modle I bought her but whatever model it was, it was a lot better quality in sound and the foam padding was better. Grandma's modle was also about $100.This modle kind of sucks! The foam padding is poor quality. The bass is too low if you're not able to adjust it with an equalizer. The treble is too high. Overall, they do sound ok in certain aspects. There's not a comforable feel around your ears in the sense your ears are totally encompassed providing a encompassing sound.I wish I would've payed twice the price and bought their better modle but I couldn't afford that expense at the moment.They are good if you live in an apartment and you like to turn the TV or Stereo up after a certain time of night. The sound quality should be better than it is for the amount of money you're spending. I think think the price covers the fact that they are wireless and rechargable but thats it ... the price doesn't cover a better sound as you would get from a headphone that isn't wireless.So do I think they are worth it? No! I would've rather waited, saved more money and bought the better modle or bought something that wasn't wireless. Will I return them? No, because I can't justify spending over $100 on headphones right now but I would if I could afford it.  So I suggest forget about these headphones if you're looking for a nice sound to the music you want to hear out of them. Buy them if they are for an elderly person who needs help hearing thier TV. Buy them if you're only using them for TV and want wireless. Do not buy them if you want to hear quality music.UPDATE!I originally bought these for my 11 year old as a Christmas Present as he is a ""Gamer"". Because he lives 3500 miles away, I usually make sure the things I send him work. I also wanted a pair to listen to music and tried these out for another future purchase. I've tried these out a few times over the past 3 weeks to see how they work and the quality you get from listening to music (Hendrix/Clapton/Albert King/SRV/Marvin Gaye/Dylan/Marley/McCartney/etc. in my case) are extremely poor. I would not buy them again for ANY reason! I do think they will work out well for a 11 year old ""gamer"" as the volume isn;t so high where it will damage my 11 year old ears. These are not headphones you can enjoy great music with as the speakers can't handle mild bass at all. Turning them up all they way isn't very loud but causes them to distort. Again, with this in mind, a youngster wouldn't want to turn them up all the way because it would sound like crap! Using them for TV and gaming seems to be ok for a wireless headphone.",1318982400

"05 16, 2012","[0, 1]",1.0,Much worse than predecessor,B0001FTVEK,Burt,A1AMAN3388Z1TK,"I have had the predecessor to this product for five years and loved it.  Unfortunately, it finally bit the dust, so I went on Amazon for a replacement unit.  I am VERY unhappy with this piece of junk though.  I will be returning it and looking for some other product to fill my needs.To set the stage, I use this to listen to an iPod at work.  I am a software developer, surrounded by 3 large monitors, with the transmitter sitting on the side, about a foot from the nearest monitor.  This worked great for years.  This product is worse because:1) The headset now uses a continuous dial to tune to the transmitter.  It used to be a 3-position switch that you matched to the 3-position on the transmitter.  Set them the same and forget it.  Now you have to set the transmitter, play some music, tune the dial on the headset for maximum reception... and don't move.  You actually have to tweak it occasionally to keep it tuned if you move around very much!?2) The tuner on the headset is right beside the volume control.  It was always this way, but now they are both rotary dials that feel the same, instead of the tuner being a solid 3-position switch.  Very easy to touch the tuner instead -- and have to retune again.3) The headset is much harder to charge than before.  I used to just set it on the transmitter when I left for the day, and I knew it would be charged when I returned. With this new unit, it doesn't really make good contact.  I have to make sure the charge light is on, then wait a few seconds and make sure it doesn't go off.  If it goes off, I need to reposition the headset for a more secure contact.  I have twice come to work to find it stone dead and unusable because the contact had slipped off.4) It is MUCH less comfortable than the prior headset (and the old headset won't work with this transmitter).  I have a large head (7 3/8"" hat size) and I find this thing squeezes my head.  No band to adjust the width.  Try to stretch the metal out and (of course) it just springs back.  Also, the ear pads are less comfortable, and do not conform to my head like the prior unit.5) The sound is TERRIBLE.  OK, this should probably be first, but I wanted you to read all the other faults, so I put this last.  There is a repetitious screech that can be heard every few seconds, then goes away (for a few seconds).  I am pretty sure it is the crappy AGC circuit.  I mostly listen to light rock, pop, jazz and the like.  If the music gets even slightly more quiet for a moment, this sucker cranks up, then slams down the gain again when the music returns to normal.  The result is a horrible listening experience.6) It just goes over the top if the music is turned off.  Someone comes up to me to talk, and I press pause on the iPod and take off the headset.  It will go to auto gain and screech so loud, it disturbs our conversation when it is sitting on the desk!  I have learned that I have to turn it off before turning off the music to avoid this.  I then must make sure I turn on the music BEFORE I turn on the headset, or I will be hit with that squawking again.It seems they let an intern design that Auto Gain Control circuit, and never bothered to do QA on it.

They can operate at the same time on different channels with no interferance.  If a friend comes over, I'll grab the set from the bedroom and run both headsets off the family room transmitter.

The recharging cradle/transmitter works great.  I never have to worry about the batteries like my old pair.  My only faults are with the sound at a high volume and how they sit on my ears.  I wished they would cup my ear instead of sitting on my ears but it really doesn't bother me that much.

Too bad they don't have a low voltage wired transformer that you could plug into AC next to the bed to plug into a head set for recharging or extending a dead battery condition or charging a second headset (2 don't fit well on one cradle).

Between dealing with cables too short to move around my workspace and losing sound on one side because the cable was stretched or pinched too much, I felt I had to find a cost effective solution that did not involve broadcasting my music to the entire office.  After checking Sennheisser's website, I settled on this set.This is probably the single best headphone purchase I have ever made.  It took less than one minute to set it up. I can easily move around without ripping anything off my desk.  In moving 20-25ft from the base, I have no drop off in sound.  I usually leave it on the entire workday (8hrs) and never had it run low on a single charge.  The sound exceeded my expectation on music.  I will admit, there is an annoying hiss/hum when I just listen to talk radio or podcast (ie only when vocal sound is only output is it noticeable).  Besides the hissing/humming, there is a small crack that has developed on left side of the headband.  This is a related to the design of the headband and the fact that I have a huge melon for a head.  It has not affected the use of the product.  Overall, I am glad I made this purchase and would easily recommend them to anyone else.It requires external power for the base (wall plug), two AA batteries for the headphones (included), and an audio source.

I prefer the push button power switch on the old cheap set to the slide switch on these--but as long as it lasts, it's just preference.I would really like it if the charger stand and the transmitter were two separate units.

At that point the adjustment knob comes in handy to adjust you to a better frequency for the best reception.  They feel good on your head too.

The sound quality when used with the computer was very good. However, the power cord to the charging dock failed within two days and the headset stopped transmitting. Why are the majority of modern products so much better looking yet work so poorly these days?

The sound quality is amazing and it's insane that I can have them on while I'm in the garage, 4 rooms and 5 walls away and still be able to hear my television, crystal clear. They're also easy as heck to charge, all you need to do is slide them onto the metal bars of the base, just making sure the exposed section of the headband makes contact and the red charge light comes on. That's it. I've used them as long as 10 hours on a single charge, I don't know how much longer they go beyond that.I can't take a single star away from the headphones, but there's one thing that I wish Sennheiser would work on (please, please!). The headphones are flat and don't cup the ear so all it takes is for me to tip my head forward just a bit too fast and these drop right off.

I had purchased a set of more inexpensive Sony mdr-if240rk headphones earlier that had an unbearable amount of noise when using them on my 50"" Panasonic plasma flat screen. When I tried the Sony headphones on my 46"" Vizio lcd, they worked just fine. Having had such a good experience with Amazon in the past, I knew that if I ordered the Sennheiser headphones for my Panasonic and had the same problems with noise that they would take them back. Even though the Sennheiser's cost a bit more than the Sony's I went ahead and ordered them. The sound quality and separation is amazing.

They feel well built, too (see prior comment).

I found a headphone jack 3.5 mm jack for the computer and a set of RCA audio jacks in my package . I have Fibro and severe chronic pain . Zero quality of life until I put these on WOW . I own a acre and a third with a house at one far end . I walked to every point on my property after closing the door to the house and setting these up on the wall 3 feet above my computer and had no problems until I ducked behind a old Wells cargo trailor 400 feet away . Otherwise I did get some crackle but it was no worse then old vinyl scratches . My garage is behind the house I walked in with closed the doors and there was a van between me and the house and I heard everyting fine . The charging cradle is fine . Its easy to change the batteries and it came with rechargeables . Bottom line it works well . Sounds were crisp within reason for the crackles and pops . It scared me to think the radio waves were everywhere . I thought the bass was great . I like the position of the dials its not confusing . There is a adjustment on the base that helped me lock in a signal everywhere . Now the bad .These headphones are for people sitting or walking easy . When I tried to bend over with them they fell off . I didnt get on my lawn mower but it would be about as far as I would push activity with them . They feel clumsy and akward for me and I imagine most people . I wore them as small as they would go and I am a 7 5/8 hat size . Maybe my ears are high on my head I dont know . Compared to the technology I knew these are a 6 but take two off for a 4 on a 5 point scale . Definitely worth the money but dont expect to do work in them you will have to find another model . I would love to hear what people are using for that . The range for me was unbelievable compared to what I expected . I never believed the claims . Now you do have to tune them in and adjust a little . My base was hung on a simple paneling nail on the wall above the computer with a light switch a foot away , air conditioner running , monitors , tv and a wireless phone system . No problems . The volume turns up just high enough to be pleasant yet safe . A very good purchase . These replaced a nice set of RCA's which sadly were lost before the package was even openned . I couldnt buy them again and I dont feel sad anymore . I would buy again but hopefully the other pair will be something for working outside now that I know the tech can reach out there . These would be great for landscapers just leave the truck radio on with the base plugged into a inverter 12vt charge pack . I will comment later as I havent tried them with tv or just the computer alone yet to run into issues where people complain of the auto shut off / gain feature . I cant wait to try these with a usb phono I bought recently for my old 45's ,78's and 33's . For one brief moment my pain was bearable it was worth the money . Please recomend in comments a headset that may work with the base or not that is wearable while bending or being more active . Thanks ..God Bless .",1245542400

Allin,A14SE86R3GRPNC,"For about 10 years, my job required me to wear headphones every day, all day, and I tried every type and brand there was.  Sennheisers were by far the best, with a combination of excellent sound quality, all-day comfort, and long-term reliability.  And unlike other brands, you can always order replacement parts if needed.  These wireless headphones replace a cheap set that were uncomfortable and unreliable.  The Sennheisers worked great right out of the box, with range that reaches anywhere on my property, inside or out, with crystal clear sound and terrific stereo separation.  The recharging system is foolproof, and the transmitter was very easy to set up.  The only downside is that the headphones, in order to be comfortable, do not clamp down; thus, if you bend over or lean back, they may slip on your head.  I would also like to have a tiny LED on the headphones themselves to let you know they are on, so you don't accidentaly leave them on when you aren't using them. These are minor gripes, however, and don't really detract from their overall quality.  The more expensive brands, like Bose , may offer a technically better sound response, but I doubt anyone could actually hear the difference, and it certainly wouldn't be worth the higher price.  I have a set of wired Sennheisers that I have used regulary for 20 years, and they sound just as good as when I bought them.  I had to replace the foam rubber ear pads once, but they were readily and inexpensively available through the Sennheiser website.  You simply cannot go wrong with Sennheisers.",1305763200

Carter ""Smoky Mountain Carpenter""",AK3J3SVYLR6ET,"Perhaps I've just been unlucky, but I have found the Sennheiser headphones extremely unreliable.  I was very pleased when I first purchased the unit--after less than a week they went dead; i.e., the charger continued to work, but no transmission.  I returned the unit and got a replacement.  My only annoyance was that, occasionally, it would simply cut off.  Gradually this became more common and annoying.  I knew it had a 2 year warranty, but didn't realize I had owned it as long as I had.  Finally last month, it became impossible to use because of the constant shut-offs.  When I checked my warranty & sales slip, I realized I had owned it for two months beyond the warranty.  When I prepared to order another one, I mentioned it to my son.  Turned out, he had the same problem with his Sennheiser PS 120 and--though he didn't return it--he doesn't use it any more because of the sound cut-off.

I connected the base unit to the Audio Out (RCA jacks) on the back of the set, and the audio came through the wireless headphones loud and clear, along with the regular TV speakers. So I pressed the Mute button on my TV remote to quiet the speakers, but it also killed the audio coming from the headphones. The instructions that came with the headphones offered no help or hints about a solution.I studied the Sony TV users guide and discovered that the Audio Out jacks had two modes - Variable and Fixed. Variable means the output varies with the volume control. Fixed means the output is constant - not affected by the volume control or mute. As it turns out, whether the output is variable or fixed is configured by the Sound Settings in the XMB (Xcross Media Bar) accessed via the Home menu on the Sony Bravia remote. Once the Fixed Autio Out setting was selected, the sound on the TV speakers could be Muted, and the wireless headphones worked as expected. Hope this helps",1293494400

So I bought two pair with one charging cradle just to be sure I wouldn't run out of power in the middle of a movie. What a great buy. Comfortable, occasionally a bit difficult to keep on my head when I bend over to pick up a newspaper or something, but with a range allowing me to roam my house and not miss a play during a football game or a pitch during baseball, I consider this one of my better purchases of recent years.

I found that I could not use it on my Toshiba 32 inch LCD because I needed an audio adapter for it. It seems that most newer tv sets have an optical audio output connection and the Sennheiser headphone is not equipped to attach to this type  output. When I attempted to attach the headphones to my tv set I found that there was no headphone type audio output connection on the set. Through research I discovered that I must purchase a digital to analog adapter along with cables for about $30 so that I can use it. It is not just the extra money I must pay out but it is the inconvenience of having to go through the extra work to do the research and to purchase the adapter that may or may not work. As I understand it most new tvs have the same type of audio output as mine does so I know I am not the only person who has experienced this issue. Sennheiser sells many different headphones and other audio equipment, they should be able to keep up with new technology.

Fawkes ""Person""",A1RLO809H0LCI9,"Pros:Great soundGood fitEasy, stylish chargerLight weightCons:Don't like to stay putVolume/Tune knobs unprotected and next to each otherAutooff generates staticThings I haven't tested suffciently:Battery lifeRangeThese headphones do what wireless headphones should do: They play sound, and they play very rich sound. I'm happy with these headphones, and would buy them again. This review mainly deals with issues I've had with them, so people have a better idea about the product.First, my biggest issue is that the Tuning and Volume knobs (well, wheels) are unprotected. That means there is nothing preventing you from brushing them if you settle back into a highbacked chair, or scratch an itch on your ear. You might get treated to a jarring blast of static if you bump the Tuning knob accidently.The odds of this happening are compounded by the fact the knobs are next to each other. Several times I've gone to adjust the volume only to have the music turn to static. This is pretty annoying; the ability  to stop the tuning from being adjusted with a Hold switch or similar would do much to improve these headphones.Another annoyance is that the base station, but not the headphones, go to sleep after several minutes of no sound. I have these plugged into my computer, and was listening to a CD while lying in bed. I was not quite asleep when the CD ended, when ZAP! I was jolted out of bed, ripping off the headphones as the silence was replaced by very loud static. Needless to say, these aren't going to be used to help me sleep anymore! However, whitenoise is said to help you get to sleep, so perhaps this a feature and not a bug. Perhaps a switch on the base station to prevent this would be useful. (These are also ment to be plugged into a TV it seems, so perhaps this wasn't a consideration for its intended use)The last isssue is that while the headphones are very comfortable and fit well, they don't fit very well unless you are almost motionless. If you want wear these to do chores like I do, you'll be constantly adjusting and trying futility to keep them on your head. If you're sitting in a chair listening to music or watching TV, or sitting at the computer, this won't be an issue. But if you want to listen to some tunes while mopping or doing dishes, you will encounter some issues.Again, even with these issues, I'd still buy these again.",1218931200

There is some buzz/hiss but for the price, I think they work quite well. As others have noted, if you turn up the volume on the TV, you don't have to turn up the volume control on these headphones as much, so that reduces the hiss.  They are a bit stiff/rigid and the padding is not super plush, but it's decent enough for periodic use. I don't think I'd want to wear them all day in an office environment, though.

"06 2, 2012","[1, 2]",2.0,Overpriced and flawed design,B0001FTVEK,"DJK ""Dave from Philly""",A30G4E3XP46D9D,"I was very disappointed with this product. For $86.84 I expected more. In fact, a previous headset, Logitech Wireless Headset H760 With Behind-the-head Design (981-000265), was much better and some $22 cheaper to boot. Unfortunately, I stepped on my Logitech H760 and thus the need for a replacement.The item performs its intended function but it's nasty. Here are the things that I do not like:1. Its size! It has a cradle that it rests in when not in use, and this takes up a lot of room. The headset itself is also large and clumsy, and sits on your head precariously. It has a tendency to slide around so it's not appropriate for, say, listening to music while you work out. It's good enough if you're sitting mostly still and watching streaming video though.2. It is not really designed for a PC. The manufacturer overcomes this by shipping the product with an adapter so that the red and black composite stereo plugs that are attached to the headset's cradle can be used with a PC. But the adapter is very loose and is a constant source of annoyance. It comes disconnected at every opportunity and I am always having to space backwards on my show to catch what I've missed.3. Once the flow of sound stops, after a few minutes of silence a loud and annoying static begins to kick in for no apparent reason.4. There is a button that is labeled ""Tone"" but it should read ""Tuning"". It (apparently) adjusts the radio signal so that the headset can find the exact channel on which the sound input is being broadcast. If this button moves for any reason you will first lose sound quality and then you will lose all sound completely. (Or maybe it's just that the adapter is loose in the sound port. See #2.)5. The headset itself is cheap cheap cheap. It is dumpster-quality plastic. I was hoping that by paying more I'd get a good solid headset with good sound, kind of like my Bose headset but without wires. But no, it's not like that.6. The sound quality is quite basic. Basic is good enough for what I use it for (watching streaming video and youtube) but I was hoping that for $86 I would get good sound quality, maybe even some noise cancellation or something like that. But no, it's not like that, either.I've actually re-ordered the Logitech H760 even though this headset is not broken yet. But I hate it so I'm forking out another $62.

However, if you are in any environment with any type of wireless interference, these will degrade the audio to the point of not even being worth listening to.

Here is an honest review of it and take it for it's worth. I am not an audiophile but I have gone through a lot of headphones and earbuds  throughout my life.The Good: It's super easy to install whether have an old TV with headphone jacks or a TV with audio jacks. Charge up for 24 hours and tune it up like a old radio and your good to go. The hiss everyone mentions is there if you don't fine tune it. But once you have it set you don't have to mess with it.The Bad: The sound the headphones produce lacks depth and bass, the sound is tinny. Though clear it sounds like your holding a can over your ears. This is perfect if you watching the news, debates, or anything where people are having a conversation. I watched a concert and a movie on my HD TV with it on and it sounded terrible. It's all mono and basically not worth using them for that purpose. Since these headphones mostly produce treble after you use them your ears tend to hurt.The Ugly: Your paying for the Sennheiser brand, I am not saying it's a bad brand I have other headphones by them and they are excellent, just not this product. $80 - $100 is way over priced for the performance of this item. They should be branded $40 - $50. Look elsewhere if you want something that has better sound and performance which this item lacks.",1388534400

The cups around the ears are small but fairly comfortable since they don't press.Unfortunately, our issues are ones we've not previously encountered with other wireless phones.  Most problematic is the design of the band over your head.  While it's comfortable, the plastic tends to bend and not maintain it's shape, making it sometimes difficult to place on the charging cradle and charge the unit.  Also, there's no light on the headphones to let you know they're on, which means when they're not on the cradle, you have to physically pick them up to check to see if they're on.  Lastly, if a wireless house phone is in use within twenty feet or so, the unit picks up interference and sometimes even the conversation.All in all, a good product for the price but a bit of a disappointment, considering the quality of the Sennheiser brand.",1231632000

Even then it didn't make sense why they would put the ""tune"" dial under the ""volume"" dial since presumably you only tune it once.  But I figured maybe they were going retro.Unfortunately they weren't.  In fact these headphones, which in the 1970's probably sounded pretty good, aren't serviceable now because there's so much noise in the 900Mhz spectrum that you constantly get popping and buzzing and other artifacts in the soundstream.  Which is tragic since they sound quite good, the charging system is top notch, the battery life is probably good (I never ran them out so don't know for sure) and they are light and comfortable.In the end I had to return them.Dear Sennheiser, invest in a couple of EE's under the age of 50 who have heard of a DSP and do a nice digital version of these and you'll have a great product.",1289606400
"05 24, 2014","[2, 2]",4.0,"Excellent sound and reception, mediocre fit and comfort",B0001FTVEK,Doug Stevens,A2IQM22V0QM4I6,"This is a first impression based on a lot of use in two ways for about three weeks. One purpose was to use the headphones to enjoy Sirius received via a computer throughout a medium size apartment. The other was to watch TV and be free of the varying clicks, pops, and hisses that I have dealt with for years with my otherwise excellent Sony headphones.From a reception and sound quality point of view, the 120s far surpass the Sony wireless phones. No noise at all when watching TV and excellent sound. Excellent sound when using the computer to enjoy Sirius as well. No interference anywhere in the apartment.The downside, which could prove to be significant, is fit and comfort. The headband is adjustable, but I have yet to find a position or adjustment I could really call ""comfortable,"" and they tend to slip around. The Sony's were far more comfortable and stable on the head -- if you could stand the unpredictable clicks, pops, and hissing. In the end, sound is the key feature and the Sennheisers have been great in that respect for three weeks. I hope to get used to the comfort and stability issues.I found them extremely easy to hook up to a Samsung TV.At first it can be a little tricky to get the headphones to sit correctly on the recharging stand so that recharging occurs, but that passed quickly. Probably due to the excessive simplicity of the headband, it can't detect whether they are on a head or not, so you have to turn the unit on/off manually with a switch on the left ear cup. Another minor annoyance.Another plus over the Sonys is tuning and reception. Unlike the Sony, there are no transmitter switch positions to set on the Sennheiser base, and no corresponding switch positions to set on the headset. All the tuning is done on the headset with a simple dial that works well. But since it's adjacent to a similar dial for volume, your finger will need to learn to remember which is which. If you can't hear anything or if volume is low, it can be either because the volume is turned down (obvious) or because the tuning needs adjustment (not as obvious).In some respects this should be a 3-star review because of the level of fit and comfort. But all of the performance aspects linked to sound are so good that it would be cheating the unit not to give it a 4-star rating.",1400889600

"03 18, 2014","[0, 0]",4.0,Ear Piece Problem Solved,B0001FTVEK,drnox,AYRBBREH7O3SO,"I had an 10 year old pair of wireless headphones that I wore to listen to music while I worked around the house. I dug them out of the closet and started wearing them for listening to the TV when I was working around the house. It was nice to still be able to hear the show when I was doing dishes or in the next room or whatever. The hiss was pretty noticeable, but still range was great and I was just listening to TV, so it wasn't that big of a deal.My mother lives in a retirement home and, due her poor hearing, struggles to hear the television (so she always has closed captioning on). I figured a set of wireless headphones for her would be a pretty cool gift and I could test drive them to see if I wanted to upgrade. So, I bought the RS120s. The sound quality was much much better than my old set. Almost no hiss at all. Cool. I set them up at mom's. The first thing we heard was a neighbor's telephone call (this was pretty much crystal clear too). I guess they had an old 900MHz telephone. That was only the first night though. After that, it wasn't a problem. She struggled with the philosophy of tuning the headphones to the base thing, so I bought her a set of the RS160s (and I took the RS120s).The RS160s weren't as convenient for charging (she has to plug them in as there is no charging stand), but there is no tuning involved (you just have to pair them, but that is not hard). Another key difference is the RS160s are over-the-ear headphones (an outer foam ridge that goes around the ear), not on-the-ear headphones (a flat foam pad that lays on the whole ear) as with the RS120s. You can see the difference when you look at the pictures, but none of the reviews I read mentioned this. This is a huge difference to me. Over the ear headphones cup your ears and stay on if you lean over. On the ear slips off even if you bend slightly forward. Major pain when you are working around the house. Unfortunately, while the RS160s don't suffer from this same drawback, they don't have the same range as the RS120s - they sound absolutely great when you are in the same room, but start cutting out when you get much further away (and since they are digital, they don't just get more static, they cut out).So, I compared the size of the ear pieces on the RS160s with the RS120s and they were pretty close. Close enough that I decided to drop $12 and buy a set of replacement RS160 ear pieces and put them on the RS120s. They got here today. It was a breeze. I just pulled the old earpieces off of the plastic piece that fits into the phone and put the new ones over. They are slightly bigger and not exactly the same shape, but I put a couple pieces of cellophane tape to hold them onto the base before I put the earpiece assembly back on the headset. You would never know they didn't come this way. Best of all, they stay on and I get the range of the RS120s. Why Sennheiser didn't make them this way, I have no idea. So much better.Link for replacement ear pieces below.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DEYA5UO/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1",1395100800
"06 20, 2012","[1, 1]",5.0,I love this product!,B0001FTVEK,D. Roberts,A342ZILZJ260ST,"I read most the reviews before ordering my Sennheiser wireless headphones with charging cradle.  We have three TV's, but I only wanted to order one to test it out.  My husband loves listening to sports on the living room TV set and I am not a sports fan.  I would often ask him to turn the TV down and he would get annoyed at me.  I bought this for that TV and he hooked it up.  At first, he did have static in the earphones. But he had the living room TV hooked up through his giant speakers that he also uses for his CD Player.  I suggested he take the TV off those speakers and just let it work thru the TV speakers.  When he did that, there was absolutely no static.  The sound is terrific, clear, and the earphones are very comfortable to wear.  Now he can watch sports all the time and not bother me.  Also, our house has an open floorplan and the kitchen opens to the living room.  I like to turn on the kitchen TV to watch news when I am cooking.  He dislikes hearing that set.  So I ordered a second Sennheiser set for the small TV in the kitchen.  Now I can watch news and work in the kitchen and it doesn't bother him.  I credit this product for saving our marriage from discord over different tastes in TV viewing.  I was so happy with the product that I ordered a third set for the library TV.  They are real easy to hook up and all three worked perfectly with clear sound and comfortable to wear.  If someone in your house plays the TV too much or too loud, this is a perfect solution, and very reasonably priced for the quality you get.",1340150400
"07 28, 2011","[1, 1]",3.0,My Accurate Review,B0001FTVEK,Dr. Penrose,A2IDM0KG1I54WG,"Just got these yesterday. Read instructions, put batteries in and let it charge for the full 24hrs before I used it.The good on power:I have had no issues with charging so if any review complaining of that is experiencing this later in the product ownership there is nothing actually preventing you from charging it. Yes if you move it a little off etc it stops charging but if you just sit it on and leave it there with the charging confirmation LED you are fine. It works as intended and is very convenient. Also a plus is the ac adapter which apparently is designed to consume less power than needed.The bad on power: It said in the instructions you must charge the batteries for 18hrs subsequently after use. I have no idea why they say this or if it's even true but this was misleading to me. I only throw it on the charger when i'm done with it and use it when I need to. As for battery length I have been using it for almost 8hrs straight so far with no problems I will update how long it takes until it dies out following the 24hr initial charge cycle. It sucks that there is no option to charge a separate set of batteries while you are using the headset off the charger because once they die, what then? It's a wise investment to get the best/right battery upgrade with independent charger. Make sure you never use anything except rechargeable tripe a's as per the instructions.The good on comfort/design: This set seems sturdy and has a very acceptable build quality. They are more aesthetically pleasing than the other models in my opinion. They are also very comfortable which is great for extended use.The bad on comfort/design: The trade off for comfort is that these do not clam onto your head at All. They are built ""wide"" and are just really bad at staying fit. Any jarring or thrusts in any direction, especially if you have a head of hair will uncomfortably shift them forward and back off your head. This was very inconvenient and also prevents using the wireless benefits in a lot of situations such as on a tread mill where you would need it to hang on. This was a loss in star alone. I understand it's a trade off but I would have settled for a more snug fit and sweaty ears then such a loose fit. Some may have a fatter head to put it bluntly and not experience this as much or come to appreciate the design in that case but I have a nice size normal head and it was just not good enough. Others have commented on this.More: The biggest fail on the design that equaled another star for me is how amazingly loud the open ear design is. It was the very first thing I noticed. If you blast these or literally have them on any sound level they are COMPLETELY audible to anyone in around you or in passing distance! This is terrible to me. Even the cheapest pair of headphones can contain the sound to a personal distance. I do not see the purpose either. It's not like you can hear anyone with them on a fair volume level anyway, so why not make them like enclosed cans? This is just unacceptable to me.The good on reception: I have went a pretty far about 150ft on the 1st floor with the transmitter on the 2nd and have had great clarity with these. I enjoyed that a lot. I always get it in the middle of the ""beginning and end"" of the loud part of the tuning knob and that works best.The bad on reception: This was another star off. The reception can be very finicky. What I seem to experience is the further I am away from the transmitter the Better it is! I cannot explain this. There is absolutely no interference as I turned off everything except the WiFi (which could be the issue) and you would think being closer would be better but I guess it's like a WiFi network where too close is bad. I am within 5-8ft of it and cannot make it farther because the cabling provided will not allow for that. I am just really disappointed with the clarity. I mean the slightest shift in movement or turning your head is accompanied by distortion and crackling or static. Mainly static. I have tried every one of the 3 channels to no avail. I find myself having to find a spot and staying fairly still.The reviewers claiming a hissing are absolutely correct. I have the audio sources on max and the headphones on medium and when a track comes to an end there is a definite hissing sound as you would hear in your car while on max but much more audible. It's not quite obnoxious but definitely noticeable. I find it unappealing and being someone who has always wanted to try Sennheiser products this certainly was a sad experience in that regard.I will be returning these and chalk it up to wireless headsets being an unrefined technology. I will be testing the more expensive ones before I rest my case, specifically the 130s and the 180s. I am hoping I will have a better experience with the 130s. These 120s seem more or less just entry level. I wouldn't even touch anything less than this model. I really wanted these to work because I had every intention of keeping them before I tried them. I cannot say enough about the freedom from wires. I am so tired of tripping and yanking the laptop about while catching myself. It doesn't happen that often but that benefit plus not having wires all over me is very liberating and I believe most reviews are based on this luxury and not the clarity/quality which must come first. I'd much rather have a wired set that was clear and loud than one that ever ever crackled or hissed or had static more than once per 30seconds to a minute depending on how much I move.*I must admit I experienced a ton of clipping when blasting music and more than lacking bass and sound quality but this is 95% unlikely to be the fault of the headphones since I was using it with a Vostro 1510 with on board sound; i.e. my system didn't have the necessary power to drive the hardware. I would really enjoy a wireless usb headset from Sennheiser since it would by pass the on board chip. I don't know if that's an available option or not.Final words: I remember reading about auto-tuning adjustment or something regarding volume on these I believe. I have noticed how songs shift in volume during the beginning or end of a song on occasion. It is irritating to have it essentially override my volume setting and it's not very intelligent. If someone can shed more light on this that would be nice. It doesn't happen too often but I don't like it and would like to turn it off somehow.*UPDATE: I have since tried the headset while watching an online TV show and am happy to report a great majority of the distortion and reception issues weren't present. This indicates that my on board sound processor is in fact the cause of much of the crappy sound. It just doesn't have the power to push music files hard enough to drive what these headphones can handle. I am assuming media files require much more power especially for .FLAC compared to a simple video audio stream. I am going to test it with a movie tonight and report on that but I experienced only 1-5% of the static issues when moving around while watching and I had to purposely try to. Before I had experienced 50-70% occurrence of static when moving even a little. Moving the transmitter off the floor and onto a table also helped a lot. Mounting it to the wall is convenient and recommended, it has the recessed hook built in just no hardware.P.S. I have raised the rating to 3 stars to reflect this development.",1311811200

So I was just looking to use these headphones for TV use.  However, out of curiosity, I walked up stairs and clear across the other side of our house and outside of some occassional hissing, the signal was still strong.  Given my intended use, signal strength, clarity, ease of use and value were the primary critieria and the RS-120 has met or exceeded my expectations for each of these criteria.Just a few other comments: 1. The comments of how you need to retract the headphones to allow for charging is true, but this really isn't a big deal in my opinion, and is more than compensated for by the ease of the charging mechanism which simply requires you to set the headphones down on the base.  2. The receiver automatically turns on when it receives a signal and turns off after a few minutes if the signal stops.  This was a pain when I paused a movie for a while and had to turn the TV off and on again to get the headphones restarted.  I'm not sure why simply turning the movie back on didn't do the trick since it resulted in a new signal????  However, the upside of this set up is that you don't always have to remember to turn off the base unit on your own.  3. The headphones have it's own on/off switch.  4. There's a volume and fine tuning adjustment on the headphone that can easily be adjusted without taking them off your head.  The set up is very intuitive.  5. Contrary to some other reviews, the pair that I received came with two adapters that allowed for easy connection to a standard headphone outlet or computer.Bottom line, I did a lot of research before purchasing the RS-120 and I am still very satisfied.

I wear the headphones for hours very comfortably. Sound quality is good. Reception is excellent anywhere in the house. Automatic recharging of the batteries is ingenious! I enjoy these headphones. Buy a set for yourself!Here are my two small reservations:1. The instructions are not complete enough for a person who isn't familiar with hooking up electronic devices. I would prefer a more definitive set of instructions. For example, the power supply was buried in the packaging. Nowhere did the instructions say to look for a power supply and hook it up. I thought maybe the power came through the audio cables. What do I know? Also, the instructions do not give any clue where to connect the wires to the TV.2. My TV is about 10 years old - still analog. Therefore, the volume of the headphones is directly related to the volume of the television. If the television is muted, the headphones are muted. If the television volume is low, the headphone volume is low. So to use the headphones, the television volume needs to be a little bit louder than my spouse would like.

These replace a set of reconditioned Sony head sets that my new rescue sort of beagle enjoyed. Out of the box you simply install batteries and hook up left and right inputs in to TV, and plug in base unit...no directions are necessary, it is very easy.  The unit includes, converter to phono, and also a mini plug.  They have a soft flat ear piece that is very comfortable, not sure they will stay on if you are jogging but not doing that a present, will let you know if that becomes a problem. I read that several people had problems with back ground hiss during quiet scenes, in my expereince this is not an issue, this hiss is just not there, and the sound is remarkable. You quickly discover not all tv has high quality sound, and some dramas have so much back ground ambient, that it could sound like a hiss, but it's the party in the next room, or the street, or rain, or whatever, but it is not being produced by the head sets. During a quiet scene the head set does not turn off, I have paused it, and the result is silence and as soon as you start it back up the sound is there. Perfect, a real plus for those of us that are hard of hearing.  The charging station is well designed as you simply store ( hang)the head set and it charges. The unit has over charge protection. My old set had one nice design feature,  when you put them on they turned on, this design has a switch.. on and off. Not an issue. The tune and volume are close together, you get use to where the volume is and you only have to tune it once.

Auto-off ""feature"" - if a loud-enough-for-its-own-taste signal is not received for a moment or two, the receiver portion of the headphones shuts down, prompting a HUGE and LOUD steady-static burst that hurts the ears.  This is plain STUPID engineering, and might be the biggest reason to avoid these. It's horrible.4. Ergonomics - the earpieces are flat, and not soft.  The phones will slide off your ears and head with relative ease, and are almost, but not entirely, uncomfortable.All that said, they are easily the best wireless headphones I've found in the relative price range, they remain durable and usable for the purpose, the charging/holding stand is brilliantly executed and easy to use, and they allow me to do what I bought them for.

"01 7, 2013","[4, 4]",5.0,"Good sound, good range, extra headphones available",B0001FTVEK,Ed Sejud,A3UC0BWU7CSVZT,"I bought my first one of these to keep my wife from complaining that the television was too loud, late at night, when she was trying to sleep.  And it was too loud, because my hearing nowadays isn't what it was when I was younger.  That was several years ago.  Now my wife is happy, and I'm happy because I can listen to movies on television at a decent volume without worrying about offending my wife's sensitive ears.  I wear these while cooking in the kitchen, on the exercise machine, mowing the lawn outside, in my workshop, basically anywhere in or around the house, and I still get good reception and I can keep up with the television program I was watching.  The headset gets a little loose after a year or so of wear, and it (they) have a tendency to fall off when you lean forward.  I solved the latter problem by making an nearly invisible ""loop"" out of black nylon fishline that goes behind my head to prevent the headphones from falling off, regardless how far I bend over.  The ear cups are large and well-padded to deaden outside sounds.  Because they're on my head and the television volume is low or off, I just flip the on/off switch to ""cut"" commercials wherever I am, then flip it back on again when the commercial is over.  Often, I forget about the tv altogether and leave the switch off, and I find the headphones can be used effectively to just deaden ambient noise and isolate me from the environment while reading or when I need to concentrate.  They're that comfortable.  Before long, you don't know you're wearing them.  The best part is that Sennheiser sells (through Amazon) replacement headphones, so you can keep one headphone on the charger while wearing the the second headset, so you always have full power.  Often (like Saturdays) I'll wear the headphones nearly all day, which means I get 8 to 10 hours of continuous use on a charge.  The on/off switch itself is the only problem I found with these headphones.  I've had three (3) headsets.  One died of switch failure well after the warranty period, and a second pair is getting that way after about two years of heavy use.  I recently bought the third headset, so I still have two headsets, but I'm not bummed about the switches weakness because I figure I got my money's worth out of the product as a whole.  In certain areas of the house, there is a little static, but not to an objectionable degree.  The link between the headset and the charger base unit is radio, so static happens in certain places as with all radios, depending on local sources of interference.  I'm really happy with the product after years of using it, so this is a long term product review, rather than one written the day after opening the box.  These hold up very well with hard use over the long term.",1357516800

The batteries were suitably charged already and the RS 120 sounded great hooked up to his TV.I called him about 4 days later to ask how he liked them and he tells me they sound great and he hears every word of his news shows and other TV programs he enjoys watching.I had hooked them up to the rear panel audio output jacks of his TV.  The normal TV sound can be fully muted and the RS 120 headphones still sound great since the rear panel output jacks have a constant audio level.I tried them when I was there and the sound quality is definitely rich and full spectrum.Sennheiser engineers deserve much praise for producing a superb product !",1330819200
"04 18, 2008","[1, 1]",5.0,Exactly What I Needed,B0001FTVEK,"E. Gregg ""Electronics Enthusiast""",A1X2XA3KX98Z4C,"I recently upgraded to a Sony HDTV and needed some wireless headphones to go with it.  My previous Sony TV had a pair of wireless headphones that synced up wirelessly with the TV without an external receiver or anything.  When I upgraded, I lost and deeply missed that function.  My wife is on a different work/sleep schedule than I am, so I needed a way to be able to watch TV without having to keep the volume down really low and sit like 2 inches from the screen to be able to hear it.  After comparing several brands of wireless headphones online, it seemed that the Sennheiser headphones had higher review ratings than other big name brands like Sony.  After doing some further comparisons on price, I found that Amazon was selling the headphones I wanted for about $50 less than the local Large Chain Retailer (Best Buy).After making the purchase and hooking the headphones up, I have been completely pleased with this product.  With my setup, I have the wireless receiver hooked into the headphone port of my surround sound receiver.  I can turn the volume of the TV down to Zero, and then turn up the surround sound and slap on the headphones and listen without disturbing anyone.The wireless range is very broad, and I can walk throughout my entire house and still get a good reception (with only minimal static interference).  There are 3 different wireless settings on the base of the wireless receiver (possibly 3 different frequencies).  By adjusting the base and then using the tuning wheel on the headphones, you can fine tune the clarity of your signal and minimize any distortion/intereference.  Other reviews I have read talk about a background noise/hiss when using the headphones.  I have found that by turning up the volume on my cable box and on the headphones and then turning down the volume of my surround sound receiver, I get a near perfect signal without any background noise or hiss.  This may be different for people with other setups, but I am very picky when it comes to audio/video quality and I have not been disappointed with this product.The one knock I have on this product is that it has an on/off switch on the headphones that is easy to forget to turn off (which is more a problem with me than with the headphones).  My last pair of wireless headphones had a sensor strap that would tell the headphones to turn on when you had them on your head.  Having grown accustomed to that feature, it makes it very easy to forget to flip the headphones off when I'm not using them.Overall, this is a great product.  Again, different setups may yield different results but with my setup, these headphones have performed beyond my expectations and I would definitely make the same decision to purchase them again if I had to do it all over again.",1208476800

But I didn't buy these for their sound quality, I got them for their convenience. They are incredibly convenient. Just pick them up off the stand, pop them on your head, and you're good to go. Once you're done using them you just place them back on the stand and they recharge. Very simple to use.There are a couple little oddities about these that Sennheiser could improve upon. First is the fact that the volume control and tuning knob are too close, and it's easy to accidentally knock the headset out of tune when you just want to adjust the volume. Seems like a major oversight. Next is the fact that they're a little difficult to set up, what with the channel selection and the tuning knob and whatnot. It would have been nice if the headset and the base just synced up automatically, but maybe that would add too much to the cost. Finally, if you stop sending an audio signal into the base (i.e. you pause the movie), eventually these things will start blaring static, and then they will eventually turn off. Not a big deal but it can be a minor annoyance.We use these headphones while the kids are sleeping, and I think their quality to price ratio is just about perfect.

"12 11, 2011","[5, 5]",5.0,Almost better than sliced bread,B0001FTVEK,Eric S. Anderson,AW2S1W4PZEFNA,"I have had my Sennheiser RS120 headphones for about three weeks now and I really don't know how I have lived without them. From way too much time as a roady in my youth, way too much loud music all my life, and running all sorts of equipment without hearing protection I have a very hard time hearing normal conversations.DVR/DVD watching TV with the Minister of Finance (my charming bride) has become routine in my 59 year old life. Unfortunately no matter how loud I turned up the sound I missed a lot, especially dialog. Cranking it also made the MOF uncomfortable.  She was also very tired of listening to my audio in the other room - that's how loud I had to crank it to hear it.I have a strange AV configuration. The cable is wired both into a BOSE theater system and my BOSE computer speakers. Normal mode is to listen with the computer speakers feeding the cable signal into them.  When the MOF is here we just listen to the sound on the TV.  The BOSE Theater is only used rarely.  Like watching Woodstock on DVD.No matter how much I cranked the TV I couldn't hear Henry VIII whisper sweet whatever's into whichever was the current squeeze. I tried to read lips, but that was a pain.  I looked at lots of options, and chose the Sennheiser RS120 primarily because of the reviews here. I have come to trust them a lot in my shopping decisions.As Amazon usual, there were no problems with ordering/shipping/receiving. Installation was a snap, and they were considerate enough to include a Y plug to turn the RCA jacks into a mini - nice touch and they were useful. Rechargeable batteries were included.Literally plug and play, although I let the batteries charge all night. Perhaps the niftiest design feature is the wire loop cradle for the recharging. With virtual reckless abandon you can drop them on the charger. I have never run out of juice and worn them for hours.The sound is AWESOME.I am hearing things, especially from the TV, that I have never heard. They sound as good as my BOSE acoustic headphones and add the value of being wireless. Ranges is great, base is OUTSANDING.  Be advised these comments are made by someone with real hearing issues - I can't imagine how good they would sound with undamaged ears.The controls on the headset are a little awkward but in time familiarity comes into play. I always turn them on/off in my hands so that's not a problem. The volume is the top right knob and is sensitive to the volume from the device.  The tune knob is the lower nob and when needed, is difficult to use when you lose a signal.I have been more than 150 ft. from the unit and have had no problems. I can use them in the garage, and will be interested to see how much of the three acres of mowing can be done listening with them.  Sound quality does not drop significantly with distance.The only knock I have on the the unit is probably due to the way I have it configured.  On occasion, not frequently, but enough to be annoying, it will drop the signal and provide the screech/squawk of a two-way radio. When this occurs I often have to plug/unplug the cable signal and retune the headphones.  This also occurs, again on occasion while surfing and opening a page in the browser. It would be my guess that if I had a single input source I wouldn't have this problem.I am thrilled that I now get to hear things, and hear them better than I have in years. The Minister of Finance is overjoyed at not having to listen to Iowa Hawkeye radio broadcasts in the other room.  If possible, I would give this product ten stars for the way it has improved the quality of my life. I wish I had a pair years ago. Almost better than sliced bread.",1323561600
"11 5, 2008","[51, 57]",1.0,Poor design due to auto shut off function. Disappointed!,B0001FTVEK,Espresso Fan,AAR96VRAXSIZW,"Very disappointed. My wife and I work different shifts. I purchased these so my wife can watch TV while I sleep. Unfortunately... after a few weeks of trying to live with them, we gave up and eventually sold for at a garage sale for $5.Actually... when the work, they work quite well. Yes, there are bursts (pops) of static as you move around while wearing them  (like you might hear on a AM radio station turning a thunder storm) but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. If you sit in a chair, or are in bed, and remain stationary the static pops don't occur. They do emit constant nonstop static but its very minimal (similar to the white noise you hear when wearing noise canceling headsets). Then again... if you are an audiophile it will drive you nuts! I wouldn't recommend them for music but can tolerate it for TV viewing.  For most people its notAnd issue. In fact, many don't even hear it (which explains the positive reviews)Actually... ignoring the static issue... they sound quite good.The problem is... they only work as long as there is sound being broadcasted! Once the sound source stops, you loose the signal connection between the headset and the transmitter and BANG...  LOUD STATIC!!!  Wow... it scares the crap out of you. You then must turn off the sound source (TV, receiver etc) and turn it back on to re-establish the connection to the headset.If the TV program you are watching goes silent (like during a quiet scene in a movie), or a few seconds of silence when the program goes to commercial break, or if listening to a quite passage in a piece of music... or the delay that occurs between music tracks on a record album... BANG ... The headset drops the connection to the transmitter and you get blasted with full volume static. This also happens if you hit the mute button for the TV! What a poor design!NET: Anytime, for any reason, that no sound is being transmitted... the headset thinks the TV or the signal to the transmitter has been shut off and the headset disconnects itself from the circuit. You then have to shut off the TV (or our sound source) and turn it back on to reset the headphones.I own several pairs of wired Sennheiser headphones and love them. Sennheiser makes awesome headphones but every once in a while, every manufacturer turns out a lemon and this unit happens to be Sennheisers.Do yourself a big favor and ""sort"" the Amazon reviews on this product by rating, then read all the One Star reviews.

Hiss - yest there is hiss, BUT only when I get almost out of range.  I have not found it necessary to hold my head rigid or in strange positions.  Hiss is not really a problem for me or the wife.  (Note: you will get lots of hiss if the input level is too low.  Try using line out instead of audio out)2.  Volume control too close to the tuner.  Well, since I can shift and clutch while chewing gum, I have not yet found this to be a real problem.  Takes almost no practice to get it right - just start high and work down for the volume.3.  Range - I lost the signal completely at about 300 feet thru walls and trees.  Sound quality began to deteriorate and hiss increased at around 250 feet.  Even had to face the ""right"" direction and hold my head in funny positions to get good sound past 250 feet.  Working in the garage or most of the yard, I had really good sound.  Since some of my yard is well beyond 300 feet - I could not get good reception at all times and places - not at all a deal breaker for me.4.  Sound quality.  These are NOT as good as listening to a recording with a high quality sound system or thru my Bose home Theater System.  They are intended to provide very good sound quality with complete freedom of movement.WAIT - Solved some of the negative reviews.  These headphones work great in my house.  I actually purchased them for my mother - she lives in an assisted living center.  When I tried to install them in her room, I found out that the wireless phones used by 90% of the residents interfere with the system.  There is no way to tune the headphone system with all of this interference around.  I use a newer cordless phone that operates on different frequencies, but your phones may be the problem.  Electronic interference is probably the reason for the hisssssss problems.5.  Headphone comfort and fit.  Not as comfortable as some other headphones I have used and/or owned.  Quick moves can cause the headphones to slip off your head.  Maybe it is just me, but this can cause some problems and could be fixed.  Not a deal breaker, but get used to wearing them before you move around a lot.  I would not wear them if I were going jogging.  Overall I would still recommend these headphones.  I feel that there are enough good things to offset the fit.",1253923200

However, the wireless headphones are working very well for us.My husband listens to movies and music at louder levels than I do.  I work from home and he has the sound going while I'm trying to work in the next room.  Also, he likes to watch television in the evening more than I do - which means I used to have to endure the loud noise or move to a less comfortable room for reading.  For me, these are great because they give me peace and quiet.I'm relying on my husband for the rest of this review.  He is usually very picky about sound quality, but he tells me the sound is excellent, even giving him the surround sound effects of our expensive sound system.  He has no problems with losing the blue-tooth connection or dropping connection - but he is staying in our great room and kitchen area, not going outside with the headphones.  He did discover the issue of the headphones thinking that the base was turned off if there was an extended period with no sound, but learned to work around that fairly quickly.  If he mutes commercials, he turns off the headset until he sees the show coming back and unmutes.  He tells me that the headset is warm to wear for extended periods, but not excessively.  And, as he points out, it's tough to cut out all outside noise without a good ear covering - and that causes the heat.",1356739200

My oldest (6yo) can wear the headphones, but they fall off if she moves around. Considering she wears a hat 2 sizes larger, they are designed for a much larger head.2. Their is no indicator light to show that they are on, or if the battery is charged. You have to physically look at the switch to see if they are on. Charged? Well, do you hear sound, try fiddling with them and make sure they didn't change tuning.3. The last month or so, a neighbor has started using his shortwave radio. In certain places of the house, I can pickup his conversation over his CB. Not quite as entertaining as the TV.. I've changed the tuner options on the headphones the other day and haven't heard from him again.4. Can only charge them on that gianormous base.

"02 22, 2014","[1, 1]",5.0,3 years going and still love this set,B0001FTVEK,FistHardCheese,A1UWKENVKXEHNT,"This is actually the second RS120 wireless headphone set that I bought from amazon.  The first one was 3 years ago and it is still working flawlessly. In fact, I loved the first set so much that I ended up buying a second headphone to use with the base. I bought this second set to use for my bedroom TV.  So now I have 2 bases and 3 headphones.  What I love about this set-up is that each person in my house can wear a headphone and then simply adjust the tune dial on the side to choose to listen to the living room TV or the bedroom TV.  You can use both at the same time without interference by just making sure your bases are on separate channels.After using the RS120 for 3 years, I have no complaints about the function at all.  The headphones have great range. I can be in the basement - or any other room of the house - and not lose any signal.  I can go outside on the deck or driveway and still hear the TV inside.  Once in a while walking outside or from room to room you may hear a small bit of static as you move about. Usually if I hit a dead spot with static, all I have to do is move ever so slightly and get full signal again.  In other words, the dead spots are so small it is very easy to avoid them. In fact, you have to try very hard to find a bad spot and stay in the exact place where your signal is dead. This, of course, is putting it to a very hard test because most people will use them sitting on a couch or chair in the same room as the TV and none of this will be a factor at all anyway.The only thing I would change if I could about this set is that the headphones are rather large and a bit heavy.  I'm sure this is due to the batteries and wireless receiver they have to put inside the headphones, but perhaps the newer updated models have a lighter, smaller feel to them.  But the weight is definately not enough of an issue to keep anyone I've showed them too from wearing them and enjoying how great they sound.  They really enhance my TV viewing and allow you to hear much of the subtle audio and background music much more clear.  I really don't watch my TV (especially movies) without them anymore.One last note... the batteries that come with these headphones have been amazing so far.  After 3 years, they are still going strong.  They hold a charge for at least 4 hours of continuous use. I can't exactly tell you how long it takes to fully charge them, because I just store them on the charging base when I'm not using them anyway.  If you do this, they will always be ready to go when you want to use them.  I have never had them die on me while using them unless I had left them off the base for a couple days and did not charge them between use.",1393027200

"06 24, 2009","[0, 0]",5.0,Awesome Wireless Headset!,B0001FTVEK,FLYingG0D,AEM57NVIFQ8B9,"These wireless headphones are really awesome! The base unit comes with a phono plug to 3.5 mm headphone jack adapter, and then a 3.5 mm headphone jack to left/right RCA audio adapter. The base unit has nice, long RCA cables on it. They are not heavily shielded or anything, but they are on par with a good set of headphone wires.The wireless has worked awesome for me! No static or noise or any interference! I was worried that there might be a slight amount of static due to all of my computer and electronic devices planted only inches away from the Sennheiser base unit. I have not had a single issue at all! Amazing!The headphones have a on/off switch on the left ear cup. It also houses the 2 x AAA batteries (rechargeable ones that were included). The right ear cup has two dials. One for volume, and one to tune the headphones. The volume is fine, no problems. However, I find the ""tune"" dial to be a little archaic. The base unit itself has a toggle switch that lets you select between 3 channels. I have 3 units, all set to different channels, so I can tune into which ever one I want to at the time, and my brother and sister can too. I would have preferred a similar switch to have been present on the headphones, even though it is easy as pie to tune the signal in, and you have a good wide range where you get superb sound (unlike some tuning devices where you have that magical sweet-spot that is harder than a fruit-cake to get perfect so you don't have static). The headset itself is also a bit heavy, so if you plan on leaning forward with them on, be ready to keep them from sliding off your head. Not too bad, considering they have batteries and all.The price is not too bad! And, being made by Sennheiser, these headphones are great! If you are looking for a wireless headset, I recommend these, unless you are looking to spend MUCH more, or are willing to gamble on quality. I was amazed to find the Sennheiser RS120's at such a great price and such awesome performance!",1245801600

"07 15, 2012","[2, 3]",5.0,"Great headphones, lacking only minor features that would have been nice to have",B0001FTVEK,FreeSpirit,A2W0GY64CJSV5D,"It seems most of the negative reviews for this product have to do with the sound quality, mainly the presence or absence of a hiss. So I guess in that regard its a hit or miss, nothing in between. For us, fortunately the headphones work great with no hiss. Not sure if obstructions or walls cause the hiss other folks have mentioned. We use the headphones approximately 15-20 ft away from the base, and there is no hiss. There is a tuning switch at the back of the headsets which allowed us to tune it to the perfect sound quality. Sort of like tuning a radio.Overall I am very pleased with the quality of these headsets. Quick rundown of pros and what I would like to see added to the features:PROs:- Great price. For $70-80 a piece, these are pretty good headphones given that you get the headphones, a charging base, rechargeable batteries, power cable, and an AV cable with 2 headphone jack adapters.- The headphones are easy to set up, it took me less than 5 minutes to connect them and begin using them. Fairly straight forward set up process - connect power cord, insert battery (battery goes into the headphones), charge headphones, connect AV cable to sound source, and that's really it.- Easy to use - I use this at night to keep sound in the room to a minimum. So I turn the TV volume down to zero and  power up these headphones. On-off, volume, and tuning buttons are on the back of the headphones. Takes a day or two to get used to the controls and it's intuitive after that.- Comfortable to wear - the headphones have ample cushioning on the top and the ear pieces to be comfortable to wear for extended period of time. Nice fit overall.- Charge time seems to be good so far. After leaving it to charge overnight, I have used this for over a week and haven't had the need to charge yet. I would assume 7-10 hours of use during this period. Pretty good, don't need more than that.- Sound quality - The sound quality is pretty good. Once they were tuned to the correct ""frequency"", sound is crisp. No hiss or static. Now these are no Bose NC headsets, so at high volumes, sound from the headphones can be heard by others. But I personally don't listen at high volumes, so it's fine for me. If you want to listen at high volumes, there is a decent amount of ""drift"" outside.Now to the nitpicks - these are features I can live without but it would have been nice to see these features incorporated in future designs:- Sound quality - as I mentioned earlier, high volumes are not that great on this set. It would be nice to get a leather-like trim or maybe a slightly better quality cushion that prevents any sound drift. I have the Bose NC headsets as well that I use on flights and those are impeccable in this regard.- Wireless AV dongle - not sure if something like this even exists, but here's my issue (albeit a very minor one). The stand currently needs to be kept near the TV (or other sound source) because it connects through an AV cable. This means that when I need to charge the headphones, I need to keep them on the stand by the TV. It would be nice if the stand could connect wirelessly so some type of dongle connected to the AV out of the TV. This would allow me keep the headphones by the bedside at all times instead of having to remember to keep them on the stand by the TV every now and then to charge. As I said, minor issue but it's a ""nice-to-have"" feature.Overall these are great headphones and serve the purpose of wireless sound source very well. I personally recommend these very highly based on our experience so far.",1342310400
"01 8, 2014","[1, 1]",5.0,Great product - bought two,B0001FTVEK,Frodo,A31KNXNFUZG2S,I bought two for each TV in two separate rooms.  I can have the base on different channels and use both headphones with either base.,1389139200
"02 27, 2009","[1, 1]",3.0,Not as good as the RS130,B0001FTVEK,FrogRacing,A23YLPW55X1XZ,"I purchased the RS120 and was not happy with the loose fit on the head. I use a size L helmet so I don't think my head is too small but the RS120 will not fit comfortably if you move around and it will be too large for kids.I decided to not buy a second RS120 but to buy a RS130 (2 headphones with 1 base). The advantages of the RS130 over the RS120:- much better fit on the head (circumaural headphone surround your ear like the Bose Quietcomfort 2, not a flat thing against your ear like the RS120)- better sound quality (again circumaural design blocks better external noise, and leak less sound from the headphone) and SRS surround feature improves against standard stereo- auto-tuning of the signal (you don't need to use the manual tuning button of the RS120)- better quality build (controls/switches are much better quality on the RS130 than the RS120)The base of the RS120 is not compatible with the RS130 mainly because of the surround sound feature.I get the same quality whether I use only 1 or both headsets.Overall I would recommend the RS130 over the RS120, and if this is an investment for you, the price difference seems justified to me. Look on Amazon for a kit with 2 headphones and 1 base, you get it for the full price of one headphone that you would find on other sites.",1235692800

As for the cut-out some reviewers mentioned, yes I lose the signal after about 4-5 minutes of silence such as when they roll the credits (silently) at the end of a TV movie. But it's easy to reconnect again. My only (minor) complaint is that the volume control wheel is too recessed, and not in a location where your hand 'normally falls' when you reach for it, but I'll adjust for that in a short time. Note: The Green LED on the transmitter will stay on for a few minutes even though you've turned off the TV, because (at least with my 1990's model), they had capacitors in the circuitry that hold a charge for a while after the power is shut off to the TV set. So, if the Green LED is On (indicating that the transmitter is getting audio from the source...but then goes dark (at least, for an older TV), that's natural when a TV with capacitors is being used as the audio source, and does NOT indicate any problem.",1327363200

After having these in the box for a couple of weeks and several unsuccessful attempts at installation a friend finally helped me out. He did manage to get them working. Keep in mind I have never used wireless ear phones before just top quality ear bubs. I use these in my 38' 5th wheel trailer. The flat screen HD TV is mounted on an adjustable base in a cabinet. It's hooked up to a Harmon Kardon surround system. The base for the ear phones is in the cabinet behind the TV which doesn't seen to interfere with it's reception.Here is my short review.THE PRO'S:  I have NO hiss whatsoever. The sound is clear. The mids and high range are very good. The charging unit is very easy to use and seems to be doing a great job. They are comfortable to wear and don't make my ears hot. My wife can sleep with no TV noise coming from the living room. (BIG BONUS).THE CON'S: You do pick up back ground noise such as the portable heater fan working in the background. They fit loose and tend to come off easy. The piece of foam that sits on top of your head could be thicker and more comfortable. I don't find them all that light weight but I wouldn't consider them heavy either. In my opinion the base sound is week and could be stronger.MY QUESTION:The phones work fine except when I switch the TV to surround sound. Then the signal gets jumbled, the sound then becomes fractured. For a couple of seconds it's fantastic but then breaks up. If I take it off surround the phones are very clear but lack the depth of the surround sound. If these worked with my surround sound I would be over the moon.

Such was the case with the Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones which I recently purchased. They were intended to provide private listening to my new LG HDTV. Unfortunately, that was NOT to be the case for me.My new digital TV does have the usual RCA, HDMI, & DMI connections on the back, but not a headphone jack. The Sennheiser comes with the two-wire cord fastened to the transmitter. This cord ends with the standard red and black (not white) RCA-style connectors, but also provide RCA to Phone Jack adapters. This allows you to connect the transmitter to either the Left/Right RCA Audio Out connection on the back of your TV, or plug it into the headphone jack on TV, Computer, etc.What I did not know was that the RCA connectors on my TV are Audio In, not Audio Out (they say only AUDIO). Therefore, when the headphones were connected, they did not work because they were receiving no signal. But, when plugged into the headphone jack of my computer, they worked fine so I knew the headphone and transmitter were OK.After contacting LG, they said my TV had only an Optical Audio Out connection. In order to use the headphones, I would need to purchase an Optical to RCA adapter, about $25-$50 dollars here at Amazon. And, unless you get even more expensive adapters ($80+), your Optical to RCA converter will not work if you have Dolby surround sound active. To get the cheaper adapters to work, you must first turn off the Dolby.My caution is this: Before buying the Sennheiser headphones, check your TV to make sure the RCA plugs (two of them, one red and one white marked with an R (right) and a L(left) on the rear of your TV is Audio Out.Or, that your TV has a headphone jack.If you first read the forum here regarding these headphones (which I didn't), you will see this is pretty common problem.I will give the headphones four stars because they seem to work quite well with my computer, but not with my TV. Now I'm a bit shy of getting an adapter because there is no way of knowing whether it will give satisfactory sound since I do have Dolby sound on my TV. Round and round it goes...",1325635200

"01 1, 2011","[6, 6]",5.0,Excellent Product,B0001FTVEK,Griz,A1W5793BZ7CXSU,"I own a pair of Sennheiser 170's and they are really excellent headphones but @ over $200 I didn't want to spend as much since major use of these 120's was my bedroom TV. PS, if you're buying a tv these days, be careful to check the back before buying. Most decent size LCDs/plasma's don't have headphone jacks, many do not have RCA audio outputs, and some cheap models don't even have optical outputs. I'm not sure how optical to RCA converters worked, so, I wanted one with RCA audio out in addition to optical, and second choice would be headphone jack. In my humble opinion, RCA-output is the best because there is constant output level and you then control the TV speakers with the mute button on your remote. If you are limited to a headphone jack, the speakers usually are cut out when the phones are plugged in making it necessary to be plugging and unplugging whenever you use the phones and then want to go back to the speakers. Back to the 120's. First of all - sound quality is excellent, tho I don't use them primarily for music, I'd have no hesitation to do so. Unlike the 170 and 180's they don't have features like base boost nor do they have the surround sound simulation that the 170/180's have. PS: this feature on the 170's is really cool and I love using them on my family room tv for action movies. But, back to the 120's: even without these features, the sound is great. Next, reception: unbelievable. I've been all over my house to test them and they work great, even on different floors. Next: comfort. I actually really like the ""on the ear"" fit for my purposes. Soft pads, no irritation, but haven't yet worn for hours. I can say that, since I have both, there is one advantage of these compared with ""over the ear"" fit that is a feature of the 170's. With over the ear, if your head is resting on a cushion/pillow such that the cushion/pillow pushes on the earpiece, it causes the earpiece to put pressure on the back of your ear and actually can cause irritation. It's my one complaint (albeit minor) about my 170's. The one problem wiht the ""on ear"" fit of the 120's is that it is not ""secure"" - i.e, because they fit lightly and comfortably, if you want to wear them while you're say doing a project that requires bending over, they'll tend to slip off your head/ears. If you're sitting, at your computer, lying down for a nap, no problem. But if you''re going to be active with them - like working in the garage or cleaning the house while wearing them, might consider the more secure fit of over the ear. Since they're not over the ear, they're not as noise isolating, but that can be an advantage if you want to know what's going on around you - like hearing your wife calling you or the doorbell, etc. Finally, as for some of the criticisms of others that I've seen posted on these reviews, here's my take:1. Hiss: non existent. none. I'm using these with RCA outputs on my tv that have constant output and in this mode 0 hiss at any volume even with total silence on the source. If you're using headphone jack output, probably should have the component volume up enough (normal listening level) so you don't have to crank the phones - but I've pushed the volume on these during silence on screen without any hiss!!2. Unable to charge with earpieces extended. Huh? Maybe they've changed the design of base unit, but this is simply NOT true. I've extended them all the way and set on the base to charge. No problemo.3. Volume control on same side as tuning wheel. Please.4. Auto on/off. So far no problem while watching TV.  I suppose if you're pausing dvd's frequently, this could be a minor annoyance, but if you're wearing wireless headphones the need to pause should be minimal, since you can keep listening while you grab a beer in the kitchen or take care of business in the bathroom! Here's the bottom line on this: I TURNED THE TV OFF AND CLOCKED THE TIME-TO-AUTO-SHUTOFF: 3 minutes exactly. So.. how can this be a problem listening to music: suggest if this a problem you are using a headphone jack and the component volume is set incredibly low, turn it up a bit! Oh, yeah, when the base is off, then turn the tv on, the time between tv volume ""on"" and base unit auto on is virtually instantaneous.  Again if, not getting this performance, suspect it is headphone jack and component volume problem.Overall: this is a great set of wireless headphones at a reasonable price (less than $100 on amazon) and the problems noted by others have either been engineered out of the product over the years (some of the negative reviews are years old), or the folks with problems haven't set them up correctly (using headphone jack with component volume turned too low). For best results, try the rca audio outputs and if you're going to buy a new tv, look for and get a tv that has this feature!",1293840000

The ability to recharge them by just hanging them on the stand is a good idea and the sound quality is excellent for something this price.I think the equipment works on the 900mhz frequency and it is capable of picking up one half of a conversation on a 900mhz cordless telephone. Because the phone works on two similar but separate channels you won't get both sides of the conversation. I was surprised to hear the neighbors coming through the headset when I had my PC (the sound source) turned off. If you use a newer 2.4ghz or 5ghz phone this won't be an issue, but if you have a 900mhz baby monitor or cordless phone there might be some bleed through. Luckily there is a fine tune wheel on the side of the headset and you can lock your own signal in. Oh the whole very impressed and worth 5 stars at the price.",1156809600
"03 7, 2010","[1, 1]",3.0,Good for TV; not so good for gaming or classic music,B0001FTVEK,Gui Ambros,A1V7XAW40AHFQF,"I tried it for a few days, but returned today.First, the positive:1) great sound quality when watching TV2) range was pretty acceptable. Could go to the kitchen or bedroom and still get a very decent signal from the living room.3) very comfortable in general. Your ears will get a bit too hot after extended periods, but hey, it's headphone! (of course leather would be better than cloth, but it'd be >$200 like the Bose). If you wear glasses it'll require a bit of adjustment so it doesn't put too much pressure on your glasses over the ears.4) Battery seems to last enough. I used for several hours and still going strong. My Xbox batteries gave up much before the headset.The reason I gave it 3-stars and the reasons for my return are:1) It DOES HAVE a constant hiss in the background. Differently than most other reviews I found it quite noticeable, especially on interviews and dialogs, or  when your music has frequent level changes like classic music, jazz, etc. I'm using to play RPG games on my Xbox, so your mileage may vary. As RPG games have lots of dialogs and parts with subtle music mixed with high intensity action, any small interference gets *very* annoying after a few hours.2) Also noticed there's an audible high pitch noise when the xbox is loading something from the DVD. Again, it's only noticeable during silent parts, but when you're playing Mass Effect 2 that's pretty much the entire time. I tried moving away the xbox and using shielded cables but no improvement. Also tried adjusting the frequency on the headphone and changing the station without luck.In summary, when watching regular TV or other source with constant high sound the automatic gain control will work fine and you can barely notice the hiss. If you're planning to play videogames (specially RPGs) or other sources with long pauses and subtle music, maybe you should look for something else.",1267920000

Nothing cheap looking, nothing is going to break easily; they produce not only good sound that you have been missing but there's intelligence built into the transmitter. When there's nothing to send, it turns itself off and then back on again when there is. The headphones charge magically as they sit on the cradle. No wires or contacts; the whole package is from the future.Don't worry about the ""hiss"" alluded to in the most popular critical review. You have to balance the volume coming out of the sound source with the headphone volume control. Turn either one up too much and like every other headphone in the world, you will eventually hear it. In other words, if you hear a hiss, back off on the volume of one and increase it on the other. Repeat until you achieve the volume you want.Here's some tips: If you're using the headphones for TV listening connect the transmitter to your receiver box if you're only going want to listen to that output. This way TV mute will not affect your headphones and is the only way to hush your TV speakers. If you have something like Netflix you will want to connect to the TV instead. This way TV volume is disconnected and mute is for the headphones. If you have a stereo system connected to your TV or receiver box you will need to decide where to connect the transmitter to achieve the effect you desire. So you see, there are a good variety of things to consider when hooking up. One thing is for certain; when you get it all working, you will be one happy camper -- like me. :)",1325116800

A lot, repeat lot, of static could be heard, making them unusable regardless of tweaking the tuning controls.  Seriously considered returning the unit.  However, when I connected the phones to my stereo, the sound was very good with no static.  The stereo's headphone jack uses output from a pre-amp I believe while the TV just uses signal input levels (no amplification at all on the normal output circuit).  I was able to adjust TV audio output to higher levels using an alternate setting in the setup screens and the static went away.  This apparently reduces the Sennheiser automatic gain control circuit input.  Some static may return if extended quiet periods exist in the TV programming.  Generally, the sound through the headphones is quite good with enough frequency range even compared to my basic wired phones.  The bass is good for this level of phones.  The fit is pretty good on my ears though they do shift around a bit (can't use with Xbox Kinect for example, but couldn't use my old ones either).  The usable distance range is pretty much as advertised.  Also, some reviews indicated that the charging cradle was not easy to use while I found it to be quite convenient and consider it a good selling point.Bottom line: After about 3 weeks of occasional use, I would recommend these conditionally.

At the beginning I had the same problem but switching in the base to the channel in the middle or the one at the right solved the problem completely. The sound quality is very good and more than enough for TV or movies. The recharging base is quite practical as you just leave the headphone dangling on the chrome holders an that's it.Mine came with RCA connectors and an adaptor for stereo mini plug and the bigger plug as well.In my experience headphones require some hours of use before they start to sound at its full potential. So maybe some people didn't like the sound at first but I am sure that after some hours the bass becomes more present and the sound gets fulller.I used to have a wireless infrared headphonesbefore and they were a bit annoying as sometimes when moving my head caused noise and of course I could not leave the room. The range of the Sennheiser RS120 is exceptional as it covers my entire house with no hiss or distortion at all.On the other hand they leak sound so they are not so quite to anybody close to you but anyway, the sound being leaked is way lower in volueme than the normal sound of the TV with no headphones.

What I like best is the engioneering genius that whet into the design.  There are no batteries to replace. Since it recharges while sitting in it's storage cradle, there are no plugs to plug in.  When you are finished using them, you simply replace them in their storage cradle, and the storage cradle doubles as the transmission antenna.  The sound is good, although I don't demand or are able to detect perfect sound. I'm happy with the sound quality.  The earpieces are a bit hard, made of firm foam rubber, and become uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them. Sometimes I will use them for 8 to 10 hours straight without the two AAA size rechargable batteries become weak.  After that I put them on their cradle and go to bed.  You don't have to worry about over charging them, so you can just leave them on the recharging cradle until you are ready to use them again.  Because of the brilliant design I have no idea how long one can go without recharging them.While they advertise around 250 feet transmission distance, I start picking up static when more than 100 feet from the transmitter. The tacktic of changing between the three transmission frequiences doesn't make any difference on that, all three frequencies pick up static when more than 100 feet from the transmitter.",1319414400

Also, I noticed that it was possible to buy additional headsets, so I thought that it would be a great product.However,  I was disappointed! The headset and charger have 3 different possible channels. I tried all of them, and couldn't obtain a clear audio signal on any. If you play loud music, it won't be too noticeable (because it will drown the noise); but during silences (or when playing more &#34;subtle&#34; music), you will hear significant background static noise.I thought that it could have been Wi-Fi interference or something like that (we have lots of wireless networks at my workplace), but the headset is supposed to be 926MHz and Wi-Fi is 2.4GHz (and 5Ghz), so unless the headset is poorly shielded, that shouldn't have been an issue...

Despite increasing the gain on the receiver there was a hiss you could never escape. The sound quality was OK but hardly analytical and detailed as described. The high and very lows were good for headphones but the midrange is muddy. Pop rock sounds great but more demanding music ties it up in knots.The one fatal flaw though is the volume auto adjust if you dont have music playing all the time you can get a sudden painful blast of noise. This is the main reason I rarely use it.I did let the headphones 'burn in' for 40 hrs before coming to a conclusion it does help but but it is hard get over the problems with the wireless equipment.,1234742400

The charger is as easy is placing the headphones on a stand, and the range is fantastic. I can listen from anywhere in my house or on my property.My set came with an RCA to mini adapter (look through your box carefully, it's taped to the underside of a cardboard insert), but the adapter has a very wide base which made it impossible to plug directly into a television that has a recessed headphone plug. An extension I had on hand resolved that problem.My biggest gripe is the insecure fit. I like snug fitting headphones, but these are very loose.

Way back in the day Sennheiser meant innovation, awesome sound, great value, so I expected to be blown away by these.  I wasn't.  Maybe I've been spoiled (my house and my current and previous cars have or had subwoofers) but I thought the bass was puny.  The hiss was disconcerting even after reading a review that nailed the problem as automatic level control (ALC) kicking in.  I also noticed distortion, lots of it, in the mids and highs when cranking up the volume.I thought the problem must be on my end so I tried different sources...an iPod Touch, a Windows PC, another Windows PC, a rooted Nook Color (essentially an Android tablet).  Tried different genres...Debussy, M83, Type O Negative...some blazing loud passages, some nearly silent.Then I tried some cheaper wireless phones that I've had for years to listen to podcasts @ work (Audio Unlimited SPK-9110).  No hiss, a lot less distortion but the bass was weak with them too.So I dug into my airline carry-on bag and found an old set of JVC HA-NC80 noise canceling wired phones.  I don't remember what I paid but I do remember that they were relatively inexpensive.  I put in a fresh battery and tried them out and WOW - they blow the Sennheisers away in every respect.  Actually they sounded best with the noise cancelling entirely off.  I also compared my MEE HT-21 phones but while they are excellent for use on an airplane, they just don't have the bass response I want on the ground.I'm going to return these Sennheisers.  As much as I'd like wireless phones for my purpose it seems crazy to give up bass response and endure hiss and distortion.  So I guess my recommendation is to think seriously about how badly you need wireless.  If all you want are podcasts and TV, the Audio Unlimited model I mentioned will do the trick very well for a lot less money (just replace the cheap rechargeable AAA batteries it comes with before you even charge it up for the first time).I'm really surprised that I'm having unkind things to say about a Sennheiser product.",1363392000

(When lying still this rarely happens.)o  It doesn't lock on the frequency of the sending unit.  You have to manually tune it to the frequency, and the tuning is sensitive/fussy. Once tuned to frequency it stays on frequency until the tuning wheel is moved.  But, the tuning wheel is easily moved.  When I lay the headset on the bed the tuning wheel often gets bumped/moved requiring it be readjusted.  The tuning wheel is near the volume wheel.  When intending to adjust volume you may mess up the tuning instead.o  The ear pads are continuous cloth (no open area over the ear canal), so the pads can become a little warm.Followup:  I have now used it almost nightly for over two years and I am glad I bought it.

Here are my impressions:Comfort - the headphones fit comfortably, and are balanced enough in the weight department that they don't feel intrusive when wearing them for extended periods of time.Sound Quality - Sennheiser excels in this department, and these cans are no different - they sound great with a wide response range.  I use them for gaming and streaming my music while I work around the house.  As long as you are not receiving any wireless interference, they sound splendid.Controls - The controls are fine on this unit, although one complaint I have (and I can't think of a better category than controls for this one) is that they ""shut off"" too quickly when no sound is coming across.  I understand this is to save battery life, but when I'm working on a computer, sometimes it takes a minute or two for me to get into the application I am going to work with.  If no sound comes across, the transmitter shuts off, causing static in your ears.  Not horrible, but annoying.Wireless Reception - Great! I have a large yard (2 acres), and was able to walk the length of it before getting any static.  One caveat, however, is that sometimes turning your head the wrong way, even when in close proximity to the base, will cause some static to occur.  I'm not sure this is indicative of any flaw in the headphones, however, and more likely due to something interfering in the frame of my house.  But, when they do come in, they come in very clear.Fit - The headphones ""fit"" fine, but if you lower your head to pick something up, they inevitably fall off.  I've had to grab them from the air on their way down several times.  Now, this is kind of a catch-22 for me, because I wouldn't want them to be any tighter on my head, or the extended comfort would suffer.  Not sure what to say here other than if you don't lean over, they fit great.  If you do lean over, be ready to catch them as they fall off your head.Battery Life - I can't honestly say that I've had them run down enough to know how long they would actually last, but this is a non-issue for me, because I've never had them run out on me, even with hours of music playing as I work around the house.  The fact that the base charges them while they are ""put away"" is enough that the battery life just doesn't become an issue for me.Overall - I do recommend these if you are looking for some great headphones to wear while gaming or listening to music streaming from your computer/stereo.  They have great range, battery life is a non-issue due to the charging base, and they feel great even after wearing them for hours.  A great buy.",1254787200

My older pair gave me great sound with limited range.  These give me superior sound with excellent range.  The 'fit' is easily adjusted and I can wear them for hours with no noticeable fatigue.  The charging 'cradle' is a big improvement over my old pair; those required me to remember to turn the headphones around before placing them in the cradle, being careful to position the charging points so there was solid contact.  The new pair simply requires you to place the headphones 'on' the cradle; charging contact is made automatically.My ONLY complaint with this unit has been mentioned by other reviewers; I have accidentally adjusted the 'tuning' on the right earphone when I was trying to adjust volume, but I've learned not to do that and now it's not a problem.  Speaking of tuning, for those reviewers having problems with signal sound quality, I must presume not everyone has taken the time to 'tune' their headset to the 'receiving' channel (there are three separate channels that are selected on the bottom front of the base).  Without proper 'tuning' there is indeed quite a racket through the earpieces but tuned properly, the signal is clear as a bell and of extremely high quality.

Range is great, I've been able to play in the yard with my dog and still hear the show I was watching without delay or interference.

"09 8, 2011","[1, 1]",4.0,Amazing deal for the price,B0001FTVEK,J. Reed,A1TGBDVX3QXCRH,"I have been through two pairs of wired Sennheiser headphones.  I have a pair of EH150s that I absolutely love, except for the cord.  So when I wanted wireless headphones, I immediately looked at Sennheisers.  I use these exclusively for TV and video games.  I don't listen to music with them.  I'm also not moving around a whole lot.  For me, the point of these is to play video games and watch TV at night and not have a wire running from the TV to the couch.  And for that, they do the job perfectly for the price.As other reviewers have mentioned, the base station automatically detects when there is and isn't a signal and turns on and off accordingly.  Some people have said that the signal randomly cuts out during when what they're listening to is very quiet.  I have not had any issues with this for video games, even in very quiet parts of the game.  The auto-turnoff time with no signal is 3 minutes, which is very reasonable.  So I suppose if you're watching TV and you mute it during a really long commercial break, then yes, the headphones will turn off.  ""Don't do that.""Other people have mentioned hiss.  This was a problem for me when I initially set up the headphones, but it's easy to work around.  First, play with the tuning knob on the headphones until the signal is at its clearest.  Then, mute whatever you're listening to, and slowly turn down the volume on the headphones until you can no longer (or just barely) hear a hiss.  Then unmute your source, and turn its volume up until it's at the level you want.  Problem solved, no more miss.  I think people who complain about the hiss are turning the volume on the headphones way up instead of turning up whatever is plugged in to the headphones.There are two things prevent me from giving it 5 stars:- the connectors are RCA.  They include an RCA-> 1/8"" stereo adapter, and a 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter, which is great, but is rather bulky sticking out of my receiver.  I'd rather have a 1/4"" plug, and adapters for 1/8"" and RCA.- the headphones are not as comfortable as I'd like.  Don't get me wrong, they're great for what they are, but compared to me Sennheiser EH150, they're noticeably less comfortable.  I can wear the EH150s for hours and not feel like I have anything on my head at all.  It's not the weight or bulk of the wireless headphones, it's that the earpieces and covering fit less well and are less comfortable.  (And the EH150s were $20 headphones, so it's not like they were luxury items or anything)Overall though, for the price, they're great and the best choice among similar brands in this price point.",1315440000

I have killed more than one set of headphones by them getting flung from my head to the ground or tearing off the connector.  I had been considering wireless headphones for a year or more before finally making this purchase.One of the aspects of wireless headphones that I wanted to avoid was the need to replace batteries every week or so.  I am not good about keeping batteries handy, and would probably end up not using the headphone much because they would be out of juice.  The handy charging stand fixed this issue.I have also been afraid of the dreading ""hiss"" of wireless headphones.  While no audiophile, I am not a fan of white noise messing with my music.  I am happy to say that has not been an issue.  Every once in while, if I turn my head one exact way I get some static, but it is very minor.

Could they have let the base sit.. maybe 5 minutes? 10 even?  Enough time to grab a drink of water or something?  I don't know about you, but for me, the beauty of watching TV and movies at home is the simple fact that I CAN pause, take a break, check on the kids, answer an e-mail, then go back to the entertainment.  But leave these alone for 3 minutes and you'll return to the lovely HISSS of the base shutting off while the headphones are still on.

I have trouble hearing the television sound, especially movies, the sound is kind of muddled or muffled to me.  I also bought a sound bar which made some programs clearer to hear but still found it hard to hear movies and other shows unless I was sitting on top of the TV sound bar.  I had TV ears but got fed up with how often the stupid ear plugs would fall off and the replacements were quite expensive.  Finally glued them on and they lasted until the ears finally wore out and started not to hold a charge for very long.  That's when I bought the sound bar.  Since I still couldn't hear perfectly I did some Amazon research and bought these headphones.  Performed beyond expectations.  The sounds are crystal clear, setup is easy and it's attractive enough that I don't mind it sitting next to the TV.  I was watching a show the other night and in the show a phone rang in the background and it was so clear I thought it was the phone in my house.  The background noises in the movies on TV sound like they're in my house.  Next year is probably a hearing aid but I won't need to put my hearing aid in when I'm watching TV.

"09 25, 2013","[0, 0]",3.0,Automatic Shutoff a Negative,B0001FTVEK,Keleh,A1TC98ZYIPLCIS,"I cannot recommend these headphones, solely because of the automatic shutoff feature. I use the headphones to listen to my TV while I jog on my treadmill. I have no complaints about the quality of the sound for the price. However, you must keep the volume of the sound up above a certain level or the headphones will automatically shut down with nothing but loud static. It is then somewhat of a pain to get them working again. I usually turn up the volume on my TV all the way and they will start again - but then you have to turn the volume down again to a reasonable level. If you are watching a movie and there is a brief lull or quieting in the sound - as happens not infrequently with most movies - you are in danger of an automatic earphone shutoff. To avoid this, you must keep the sound up to an unpleasantly loud level - that is not a good idea with earphones, as I understand it can lead to eardrum damage over time.Update : Since I wrote this review, I have learned that if I turn up the sound on my TV as loud as it will go, and then use the headphone control to adjust the volume, the cutting out problem is largely eliminated. Therefore I have adjusted my review from one star up to three stars. However, the earphones still cut out if you pause the TV volume for a couple of minutes, for example when you want to talk to someone or get up to do something.",1380067200
"08 28, 2010","[1, 1]",5.0,For the price hard to beat,B0001FTVEK,Kelly Carlson,AGZDSR4R8SA2S,"First the bad which are minor.1. I would like it if the tune and volume controls were not so close together but it is a minor thing.2. The connection cable ends in 2 RCA connectors. They include an adapter that plugs these into with a male 3.5 mm standard plug. The problem with this set up is there are going to be some situations where it is going to be very hard to plug in because of the size of the adapter. I can just barely plug it into my flat panel TV because of this. I promptly ordered a short extension off Amazon which will fix this. Again it is a minor thing.Now the good. These use replaceable AAA rechargeables. They come with 2 and I have some already so I was ready to go. I bought these to watch TV at night. I work odd hours so I often want to watch TV while the Wife is sleeping. Had been using a set of headphones with an extension cord which of course works, but is a PITA. I had looked at some of these that were cheaper and saw a lot of bad reviews. These work great, sound is about the same as the headphones I had been using, and no more wire in the way.So I decided to see how they sound with music. Plugged into an MP3 player in bedroom and walked around the house. Sound quality is about the same as a set of cheap wired headphones. You do need to have the volume up all the way at the source to keep the hiss out. Now if you are expecting great sound quality, no you will not get it. This same company makes some of these that cost 3 times as much so I expect they would sound much better. Bottom line for the price of these you get your moneys worth.",1282953600
"04 22, 2013","[0, 0]",5.0,wow-audio great,B0001FTVEK,ken,A146CA37V0450V,"Has great distance before a hiss starts to invade the clear audio. Headphones always charge--at least the charge light stays on when they are in holder, They charge might actually stop at full charge--I do not know, 3 frequency channels available if one is picking up some noise, or another channel is being used nearby. No such problems for me, so no report on cross-talk between frequencies. Real good frequency response----audio quality quite good. 2 aaa batteries easily pop under one earphone cover, and last forever, being rechargeable. A bit difficult to keep on head when bending over. Very slight pressure against my ears allows them to slide off, but if they had tight pressure, you'd surely get a headache. Have these on for hours sometimes and no discomfort. Use for a computer internet radio station, online storage music site, tv stereo audio--as other people in house use headphones, too, so anyone without them, have silence. Only use headband over top of head, as behind head, they'd slip right off. Green light shows when audio is present. Volume control on one ear. Also control to tune in audio for selected frequency. Another switch is on/off. Directions tell how to reset audio if lost. Unplug unit. Uninstall batteries then reinstall.  Hardly happens, though.  headphone AUDIO stops, get a hiss, so turn them off ! Hiss not heard at all when audio is present. Music and voice sound normal-------for sure, not tinny. No need to go sennheiser digital, though--since you'll also lose some wireless distance. Signal goes through walls, easily--never thought wireless could be so good.  Perhaps adding a personal chin strap to earphones on both sides, could keep them on when bending.  Headband very sturdy throughout. Sennheiser is QUALITY. UPDATE=UPDATE=UPDATE = I WAS ASKED ABOUT volts AND adapter--Must use 2 1.5 volt AAA battery rechargables in earpiece--long lasting.

"01 17, 2012","[4, 4]",5.0,Good value!  Met all my expectations...,B0001FTVEK,"Kevin Mills ""N=1""",A3JYI8OY259UVJ,"I purchased the RS120 headphone/charger system and a second pair ofSennheiser  HDR120 Supplemental HiFi Wireless Headphones(without a charger) for my wife and I to use in our bedroom so that we could watch a little TV without waking our sleeping toddler across the hall.  We've had them for about two weeks now and have used them on numerous occasions.  They work very well.  Sound quality is fine.  These are not audiophile Sennheisers, they're not priced as if they were.  They are not intended for critical listening, or for reproducing 7.1 theater sound systems.  They are simple stereo wireless headphones.Our bedroom TV is wall mounted (using thisVideoSecu Low Profile TV Wall Mount) and I have all the cables routed inside the wall including the audio cable that connects to the headphone base.  The base itself is located in the room next to our bedroom (my office).  Since the headphones use RF (instead of IR) the signal goes right through the wall.  RF interference has not been a problem either (the house is saturated with wireless signals and the base is located in a room with two or three computers that are running all the time).Range is good.  I haven't tested the limit of the range, but the headphones work everywhere in the house (meaning we can walk downstairs to the kitchen while still listening to the TV).Setup was very simple.  Plug the base in, connect the audio cable to the TV. Charge the headphones.  Turn them on.  Tune them and you have audio.Things the be aware of:1. The base has a 3.5mm (standard mini headphone size) stereo input jack and comes with an stereo RCA-to-3.5mm converter and a fairly long stereo RCA cable (long enough for my needs by far).  Your TV needs to have analog audio outputs.  The base does NOT have digital audio inputs.  The outputs on your TV will be fixed level, or variable-level (or user selectable).  Our Vizio TV has selectable outputs and I selected fixed-level.  This means that the headphones are used to control the volume instead of the TV remote.  For us, this works well as we can each independently adjust the volume without affecting the other listener.  (The downside? The mute button on the TV remote does nothing).2. I have two headphones, but the charging station can only charge one at a time.  This isn't a problem. You just need to be aware that you can only fit one at a time on the charger and manage your charging so you don't end up with a dead battery when you need them.3. I'm still on my first charge cycle and we've used the headphones for at least 5 hours over the last two weeks.  So far no sign of running them out.4. The headphones use standard AAA NiMH batteries (provided).  I'm considering buying a few more just so I have a few charged ready-to-go batteries around in case I do ever forget to charge the headphones (and our baby monitor uses the same).5. I did not mount my base on the wall (it just sits on my desk), but it does have a single keyhole mount slot.  I don't think it would look very good stuck on the wall, but if needed, it'll work.6. This is the only drawback I've found so far, but at this price point I didn't really consider this a negative:  The headphones are not the type that go over your ears.  The lay flat on the ear.  There is no surround.  Some people might find this uncomfortable during a long listening session.  When I first put them on, my initial reaction was: ""these are not going to be comfortable"".  But after using them for a while now, they really are not too bad.  The comfort isn't great, but not bad either.  The other trait with the lack of a surround is that they do not isolate sound.  You can hear other noises in the room (good for us, we can here the baby monitor), but you can also hear the other person's headphones if they are listening at a loud level (and your trying to read a book, or sleep).  Again, only a problem if the other person is cranking it up.  This hasn't been a problem for us.  I've never heard my wife's headphones while I read or sleep.So I give these 5 stars because they met my expectations in every way.  I was not expecting high-end audio, but I was expecting easy setup and decent sound quality for a reasonable price.  And that's what I got.",1326758400

My third, after receiving my order and slipping these headphones on for the first time, was simply ""WOW!""From the elegant, ergonamic design to the superb sound, the Sennheiser RS-120s can't be beat.The headphones come with three connection adapters, so they'll work with just about any TV, radio, stereo, DVD or game system. The base unit is small, inobtrusive and leaves a small enough footprint that you can find a spot for it just about anywhere.But the bottom line is they work -- and they work well. I have them set up in my bedroom and connected to my TV so I can unwind late at night without keeping my spouse awake. And on Saturday afternoons I can have the game on with the volume pumped up without a peep of complaint from her or the kids (and even if they did, I'd never hear them anyway :-) Of course, I can walk around and do chores, work at my desk, whatever, without missing a second of the action.The rechargable batteries are a great idea, too. No need to plug a cord in, simply place the headphones on the base unit metal rack to connect and charge effortlessly.My personal standard for consumer testing is whether or not I can rip open the package and get the product working without having to reference the instructions or manual.

They worked great for about 3 days then I came into work this morning and the power was off on the base unit. I tried changing surge protectors, etc. but I guess the power supply in the base died or shorted out. Bummer - not bad wireless can for the $$. I never completely got rid of the static and interference so I will probably not order a new set.  I loved the wireless aspect, but I was not expecting to hear a lot of analog hiss and occasional buzzing.Anyone know of a pair that doesn't have these issues?----These are my first ever wireless headphones. I ordered these for my home AV system but tried them out at work on my laptop listening to my iTunes library. I was so impressed I am considering keeping them at work and buying a second pair for home. Setup is dead simple, unpack it, plug in the power and plug in the audio cables to whatever source you want to listen to.Included is a dual rca to mini jack, very handy - this allows you to plug them into just about any device from a full AV system to a laptop or ipod. Charging is a breeze, you set them on the base, allowing the metal contacts to touch and a light comes on telling you they are charging. How cool is that? Now I can reduce the wires and clutter on my desk and I can use these on my laptop or iphone at work. Sound quality seems very good. I compared them to my tried and true Grado SR60's and dang it if they don't sound almost or just as good. Consider that cost about that same that's pretty fantastic.Only downside is occasional static pops. I have the base 3 feet away so it can't be a range issue. I will continue to adjust the tuning and see. So far the drops & static aren't enough to worry about. I had to play with the channels and tuning a little bit, the headphones were freaking out every time some called the phone here at the office - weird.A note to classical music fans, these are basically analog headphones - so there is some background ""hiss"" or noise - you will never notice it with the average pop, rock, jazz tune but with some classical music that have very quiet, subtle passages, you will hear a little ssssssss in the background using these.

Works great but it is not the most comfortable headset. Since it's a radio-frequency signal, I got reception of the t.v. sound all over my multistory house.

It will automatically turn off if no sound is detected, will quickly turn on once audio signal (sound) present.It'll slip off your ears real easy. Lying down on your side so your head rests on the earphone is not recommended.  This headset is best at resting on the top of your head instead of cupping your ears.  I suppose one could add extra padding or something to give it that pleasant cupped feel.Initial charging on the cradle took about 24hours as the booklet says.  Mounted cradle/transmitter on a shelf above the t.v.  A mini-headphone style plug connects to the unit and the other end is an RCA L/R jack to the Audio out of the t.v.  A power adapter cord also plugs into the bottom of the unit.  Plugging into the Sennheiser unit is difficult due to the cramped design.  Use needle nose pliers if necesssary.

"12 5, 2011","[10, 11]",5.0,Better than expected....,B0001FTVEK,Mario,AW4E5435HJAAD,"After reading other people's reviews I decided that the first thing I am going to do is test the complaints. So certainly, I tested the most popular complaint which is the auto-shut off feature, which turns off the transmitter base and leaves the listener with loud static. First of all, it is not loud static because these headphones DO NOT have the power to blast your ears as some reviewers commented. It does startle you a bit if you've been listening to silence for several minutes. But it does not blast your ears at all. One fact nobody mentioned is that the transmitter will wait for about 3 minutes of silence before it shuts off, which is plenty of time for most situations. Some reviewers made it seem like it would shut off immediately after it detected silence. Obviously, if you're going to be using these headsets with a computer it could be a problem. In that case, I would use a wired headset because when you are browsing the internet on a computer, you could spend a long time without hearing a sound. So think carefully what you're going to be using these headsets for before you buy them.Now for a bit of critique: In 2011, don't you think that technology is advanced enough to have implemented at least an auto-silence feature so that when the transmitter shuts off, it mutes the headphone? I mean FM auto-mute is an 1980's technology that even some car radios had back then to mute the FM static when no signal is being received. But anyway, on to my next item.Along with the auto-shut off feature many people hate (which I find to be no problem at all), some complained that after the transmitter shut off, if you started sending audio to the transmitter base again, the transmitter did not turn back on. This is totally false. If you spend a whole 3 minutes listening to dead air silence and the transmitter shuts off, when the transmitter begins to receive audio again it will turn back on automatically and the headset will receive the audio again. However, what I found disturbing is why doesn't the headset turn off after it stops receiving the signal from the transmitter? I waited a whole 5 minutes after the transmitter shut off listening to FM static and the headset never shut off. If I was a manufacturer of quality products, I would've considered that.Onto more positive things. For most listening occasions, these headsets will deliver crisp, full range audio with punchy bass. I was very pleased with the sound quality. However, if you are a DJ, don't expect these are going to be loud enough for you. I did find that you could easily make the bass distort as the headset itself is not powerful enough for me (I am a DJ). But for most occasions, (watching TV, listening to music in the quiet, etc.) these will do fine, though. What I found is you need to be careful with the audio input to the base. If it is too loud, you may get distortion (which is natural), and if it is not loud enough, you may hear some hissing in the background. So for those of you complaining about hissing, check to make sure your source is loud enough. I am using the headphone output from my home stereo so I can control the audio level going to the base. One nice thing though is that the base will automatically level the sound for you. If the incoming audio is low, the base will automatically amplify the audio level being transmitted to the headset. If you suddenly increase the audio level going to the base, it will automatically level it down to keep the same consistent level for you. Nice feature! I did not find that these feature dampened the dynamic range though, so your audio contrast between loud and soft sounds is nicely maintained.I can't comment much on the battery life as I just got these, but I will probably update on that in the future. But about the signal range, I find it to be very powerful. Very minor static when walking around which is normal for FM communications, but I can go to the backyard without a problem, but why would I need to do that when I can't see my TV from there?Another thing, I find wearing them for a long time to be no problem. They are very comfortable and the open design is not a problem at all. Some people complained about the open design allowing for ambient noise to contaminate the audio experience, but to be honest, once I was listening to something I could not notice any distracting ambient noise.One last thing, I find that the volume control and frequency tuning controls are hard to find by touch while wearing the headset. I guess I might get used to that in the future, but I always find myself struggling looking all around the area where I think they are with my hands until I find them. Same thing with the power switch. Other than that, these are fine headsets that I find most people will be pleased with. Since all I care is sound quality, comfort and durability, the minor flaws of this product is nothing to complain about so I gave it 5 stars. Very good for the price!",1323043200

That's the background (noise...hahahaha!) on my decision to purchase these.That context in mind, these are easily among his most favorite ""recent"" additions to the toy box.  No longer must he turn up the TV volume to 4000% to drown out such trite dialogues between people not on TV (does this shirt make me look fat?, Do you smell smoke?, Should we call 911?, etc) and risk blowing the speakers.  Now, his technophobic rear end can comfortably turn up the volume on whatever programming he is watching and drown the rest of us out.  w00t w00t!

Think of the possibilities!So, for those wanting a convenient set of headphones that have great range (easy 60 feet, through multiple rooms and walls) and reasonable frequency range, these are great.  If you want cinematic sound with great rumbling bass...well...these might not quite cut it for you.

However, my only gripe was if you weren't facing directly at the base with I had static (only 10' from base w/ line-of-sight).

Battery life has never been a problem.Minor problems: After wearing it for an hour or two, it can get uncomfortable.  Also, when my house phone rings, there is a loud static sound coming from the earphones during each ""ring"".  Every once in a while, there will be a constant stream of static - try turning toggling the ON/OFF switch on the earphones or pull the jack out & reinsert into your TV/receiver/stereo.TIP: when placing on the recharging cradle (which I actually keep behind the TV, out of sight) make sure both sides of the earphones are extended to the same length.

"01 12, 2005","[261, 281]",4.0,Nice headphones... when set up properly.,B0001FTVEK,M,A3SA70V1VVJNRQ,"These headphones work great. They're Sennheisers and you usually can't go wrong with this brand.The headphone reproduces the full range of sounds very clearly and without distortion, if set up properly (I'll get to that).I've been able to walk around my home without experiencing too much distortion. Within the same room as the transmitter, the sound is really clear and robust. It's great not being tethered to one location or having to deal with accidentally yanking the cord out when moving around.Also, unlike my other enclosed-type headphones, the design allow for air to circulate freely. So your ears won't become uncomfortable warm during use. These headphones are very comfortable.As far as specs, you can get a good assessment of the product from reading the Amazon description so I won't go into that.For portable devices with a headphone jack, you simply have to purchase a ""2-RCA (female) to headphone jack (male 3.5mm plug) adapter"". Make sure the adapter is a ""stereo"" adapter versus a ""mono"" adapter. They look exactly the same, so beware. These adapters are pretty inexpensive.I was a little concerned about getting wireless headphones because of all the negative reviews I've read regarding sound quality, interference, etc.Sound quality and hissing can be minimized if you set up properly. Here's a quick ""What to do"":Portable Players (i.e. CD, MP3, Walkman, etc):1) If the device comes with an output other than the headphone jack, use it. This other output (line-out) is usually a jack that delivers a constant, high (i.e. loud) signal. Regardless of your headphone volume level, this jack will output at a constant, strong, loud signal. These line-out jacks are usually found on the back of some CD players.2) If the device only comes with a headphone jack, set the volume to max or near max. This is the setup I'm using. These headphones were bought primarily to be use at work, so I can listen to my iPod wirelessly.NOTE!!! If you're connected to a dedicated home amp/receivers/etc... DO NOT crank the volume all the way up or even remotely close to it. (The line out on your home amp/receiver will transmit a strong, clear signal regardless of the volume setting, if you're connected to the receiver/amp's line-out)The volume should be set high ONLY for smaller, portable devices that output less power such as an MP3 player or handheld portable CD player. You've been warned;-)Why set the signal coming from your unit as high as possible? It significantly reduces the background noise, since the signal being transmitted is strong. You won't need to turn up the volume on your headset as high since the signal being transmitted is strong. Yes, your portable music player will use up power faster, but who cares? Use a power adapter for your device.If your signal wasn't strong, you would need to increase the headset volume which also increases the level of background hiss. Try it out. I would speculate that a lot of these reviews, which complain of unbearable hissing, are a result of their device's volume level being set low.Hope this info helps. Enjoy the headphones... They're pretty nice.",1105488000

"12 6, 2007","[2, 2]",4.0,Good for Office and Home,B0001FTVEK,M. H.,AI00S9IUGAA0Z,"EDIT: 2012: This become unusable at work when I got stuck in a 4-up cube. Just too much interference.I brought this home and gave it to my son - who insists on having his study desk next to the home theater. I can't blame him per-se - but he's been on the edge of eviction to his own room due to two-way noise conflicts.He hooked these up put them on and wouldn't let me touch them. He gets good noise isolation (almost too much - doesn't hear the intercom) and it's got the quietness and good range as advertised.So I recommend these - just with the caveat that they may not work well in a work cube type environment.Original follows:This is for RS120 and RS130 - and I eventually bought the RS130.I work for a computer company and bought this for my cube. A key characteristic is lots of RF noise - nearly every adjacent cube has a laptop and a deskside (or two if doubled up).Essentially all reviews were for home use. I was fortunate to borrow an RS-120 and an RS-130 at work - same floor even) I used the RS-120 for half hour and the RS-130 all day.From overall performance, I found RS-120 and RS-130 comparable as far as susceptibility to interference. I preferred the around the ear of the RS-130 over the RS-120 and my colleage with the RS-120 indicated his ears need a break from the RS-120 after several hours.The surround sound and auto tuning of the RS-130 were plusses but I bought the RS-130 mostly for the around the ear comfort and fit.Overall I really like these - but I do have some comments - and those tie back to other comments - ""the hiss in the background"".Some posters commented on ""the hiss in the background"". My RS-130s (and the one I borrowed) had this - but as Bruce Campbell said ""it's a trick - get an axe"".OK, they're not tricking you - but there is a workaround.The hiss seems to come from their on-headphone amplifier. You can make that go away by1) setting the on-headphone volume very low. Essentially dial it down until the hiss just goes away. Or a little more if you want to adjust volume more from headphone than computer.2) Crank up the drive to the base unit. I've got my computer Wave and Volume controls set very much higher than I used with my corded headphones. And now I get great volume out of the headphones. And I get it without any perceptible clipping or degradation.The bottom line - the base unit likes and is fine with driving it relatively hard - and by doing that not using much of the headset amp you sill not have a hiss problem.My last point is interference. In this very noise (ambient RF) environment at work I occasionally have a ""pfft"" as I turn my head or move about. Occasionally. Even with base 3 feet away. But so far, I've found no headset better and these are otherwise really sweet. [I otherwise can't say how these do with 900mhz phones]Overall - 4 stars and in particular prime for office use.",1196899200

To reset it, you need to get up from the couch, walk up to the sender, unplug (!) the sender from the sound source. Ten minutes later, you'll get another blast of white noise.This seems to be caused by what a Sennheiser ""engineer"" thought was a good idea: Auto-Shutoff. If the sound source signal is low for a while, the sender thinks that there's no sound to transmit and shuts off. The receiver in the headphone loses the signal and starts blasting white noise at a level that drives you up the wall. Apparently, at Sennheiser labs, their ""engineers"" only watch movies with explosions every 60 seconds, so this problem doesn't manifest itself. How this terrible design can pass any form of QA is beyond me.

The only gripe I have is that it is very easy for the phones to slip off of my head, especially if I tilt the head.  The phone is kept on the head and the ears entirely by friction, and that is why it is so easy for it to slip.  I wish the phones were the enclosed, over the ear type, so that it is far less easy for the phones to slip.  I know Sennheiser specializes on open, over the ear type phones instead of the enclosed over the ear designs favored by its rival AKG. If I did not get this pair at such a low price, I definitely would consider returning it, even though I am giving it 4 stars and I love its sound quality and performance.

The headphones not only work well throughout our two-story house, but also outside in an attached garage. Light weight headphones won't become tiresome; however, they will fall off if you lean forward to pick up something.The Sennheiser headphone 3.5-mm plug adapter, with RCA connectors for cabling, becomes a tight fit on the back side of the Visio when the two RCA male connections are attached.  But watch out for what you replace it with because the Sennheiser receiver is quite sensitive.  I connected Sennheiser's 3.5mm gold-coated jack into an input/output 3.5mm connector (not gold coated) for the TV input (for easier removal) and the Sennheiser worked fine for about 10-minutes and then started failing.  Finally the green light went out all together.  I shut everything down and restated, but still no connection with the TV ... only static on the headset (no green light).  After trouble shooting all connections and finally removing the non-gold coated connector, the problem ceased to exist and it has been working perfectly since.  I have ordered a gold-coated 3.5mm male jack with two female RCA connectors attached at the ends of two 6"" wires to replace Sennheiser's adapter.  Not an issue, just a convenience work around for me, but its noteworthy that the Sennheiser is sensitive to cabling changes (resistance).These headphones work the way I hoped they would.",1323475200

Not as good as My Koss Pro4AA, nor as good as my Sony in-ears.But, they don't have a cord which makes them perfect for guitar practice. ( one cord to the guitar is plenty to keep up with.)  So Here's the rub.  The Auto Gain Control in the transmitter is constantly riding the gain up and down to compensate for loud and soft passages in music, which is fine for many styles of music that have few dynamic changes, but is very bad for Progressive rock and Classical. One way around the AGC issue is to keep the input volume low enough for the AGC to go to max gain, but the side effect is more hiss during the quieter sections of music.The good: Very Nice Hz response, Light weight, good for tv (the AGC reduces the commercial volume), good for FM radio which used a lot of gain riding already.The bad: No AGC disable switch",1250035200

I listen to vinyl records with them at my office desk and if I bump my desk (which may cause a spike in volume), the headphones reduce volume automatically.  Which means I have to turn up the headphone volume.  Which means more hiss and audible RF pop and crackle.  And second, the damn things beep at you all the time.  I read how you can turn off the beeping by holding down a button while putting in the batteries.

The power plug to the transmitter is in such a narrow place that u need to struggle to plug it in - not a huge deal - did that2. connected it to my Desktop output - the manual says, the green light has to come up as soon as you connect the power - did not happen - after doing a permutation and combination of steps - checking my desktop output, the power cable - securing all cords - nothing happened- also tried to charge the headset with the batteries - no green light. If u get stuck in this, try to keep the transmitter on a flat surface and make sure to do all this and by luck you will see the green light - phew - finally the green light3. started listening to a song - huge hiss noise - common until we tune (that's what i thought) - did all types of tuning - reduce computer volume, reduce head set volume, use the ""tune"" on the headset, used different channels - tried to move it away from my desktop and any other nearby electronic device - same result - loud crackling sounds - hiss in between - music interruption4. OK next tried to check the range - went to the kitchen with the transmitter in the living room - started to hear huge crackling sounds - its true whatt one reviewer said - u might loose your hearing if u don't keep the sound low5. Headphones are not ergonomically designed - they do not cover the ear - no noise reduction from the outside (if u r a gamer forget it)6. Headphones keep falling down even if a move just a bit7. Sound quality is terrible - my old Microsoft Life-chat corded headphone sounds much much better - i think i am going to stick with it8. Bad user manual - i typically don't look at manuals - but this one i had to - there are many things missing - like what does the small switch named channel doesMy biggest complaint is the cost - i don't expect the headphone to rival ""Bose headphones"" - but for 67.64$ at least give out good sound with no static ? is that too much to expect for 67 bucks? - if these were around 25 to 30 then it would do some justicei didn't read the reviews and now i have to pay for the re-stocking fee and return shipping - what a waste - totally my faultif you are looking for even an average wireless headphone, i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this oneSave yourself the trouble, try it out first in a shopping center or if ur friend has one before buying",1329523200

They are plugged in to my computer and there is nothing else electronic nearby to cause the issues.

When I move or even just moving arms up/down, the noises get louder to compete with the music.Short Range - 120ft? I walked 10 feet away, and already the sound degrades so much, and to compound the issue, radio noises get louder as I get farther until all I could hear is loud static.Two stars as it's at least wireless.

I find that I do this fairly often without really thinking about it, so this flaw is really annoying, even though it could have been very easily fixed in several different cost-efficient ways.Also, I don't think they fit especially well.  They're comfortable, but the parts that cover the wearer's ears are completely flat and can easily slide off if I tilt my head down.

The only problem is the ear pieces are not designed such that they seal around your ears (look at the pictures). They are a flat surface. The headphones do not grip very tightly. They do have some mass (mass = quality?). Combine poor grip, flat surfaces and mass and one can understand why these headphones are susceptible to falling off. Don't make any sudden movements or bend over to pick something up or they will fall off. I bought these to wear while working outside around the house (and to drown out the neighbors barking dogs and their never-ending outdoor music). If you only intend to wear them while you watch TV or play video games then they will probably be okay, but don't expect them to stay on your head if you are actively moving around.Also, the tuning dial (what's with that anyway?) is right next to the volume control. The tuning dial must be adjusted to get the best reception. Not a big deal but, the location of the tuning dial is right next to the volume dial. And there-in lies another problem, when attempting to adjust the volume, you will inadvertently adjust the tuning dial. It will happen, they are right next to each other. Incredibly poor design.These are going back to Amazon. It's hard to believe all the good reviews.

So you can listen to your favorite tunes, walk around, and they will last long enough (with good batteries).Cons:There's always a bit of fuzz, the batteries do run out, which is annoying. And because the whole set is a bit bulky, you pretty much have to leave the base station in one spot. You can move it from stereo to TV, but it takes wiring, plugging, several parts.",1389139200

Also my hearing is going, so the ability to understand every word was a great aid for me. You have to rotate a dial to tune in the frequency, but that's a minor nuisance, once you get used to it. Two problems should be mentioned to prospective buyers, however. First, I find the center head piece (on top of my head) to be uncomfortable too soon - like a half hour. I'm assuming that's because they have slots for the charging stand cut into the foam on top of the headset (so there is connection for charging). The headset, for me is loose, so you can't move around much without fooling with it. Second problem, for me, was that the unit stopped working within 4 months. Kudos to Amazon for being willing to replace them. However, if I could have, I would have exchanged it for an upgraded RF unit that Sennheiser makes and would have gone for the difference. The small earpiece units that hang downward would undoubtedly be more comfortable. We'll see if the replacement has problems.

We purchased two of them, and for the most part they are very good.Pros:- Very comfortable.  Ear muffs are a comfortable cloth design, not plastic or foam.  Can wear for hours with no problem, unlike others I've tried.  Adjustable band doesn't slip while wearing.- Good (but not perfect) sound.  Good stereo, very clear, easily loud enough.  Open-air design means I can still hear things in room relatively well, which is good for holding a conversation -- while wearing the headsets -- without yelling.- Convenient charging.  The transmitter/base station is also the charger.  Hanging them on the wire hanger of the base charges the headphones (there are two metal strips on the underside of the headband which make contact with the wire hanger).  Nice not to have to plug/un-plug a charger, and then have to find where to lay down the headphones so they don't get damaged or look like a mess.  The Senheiser solution is very nice.- Good battery life.  I've yet to run out of a charge, even during long periods of use (a full day).Cons:- When audio feeding the base stations is very very low or muted for a couple of minutes, the base stations automatically stop transmitting.  This has the effect of the headsets going to just static noise at that point, which can be disconcerting.- The volume and tuning dials on the side of the headphone are very near one another and feel the same, so easy to be untuning the headphones when intending to adjust the volume instead.",1190160000

You know how Amazon puts that little note at the top when you've bought this product before?  I was surprised to learn I purchased these 6 years ago!  I knew I've had them for a few years; I just didn't think it was quite that long.I'm happy to report I've had 6 trouble-free years of use from these headphones and they still work great.  In that time we've replaced a plasma TV, a stereo receiver (both of which were purchased at the same time as the headphones), 2 digital cameras and I don't even know how many cell phones my wife has gone through.I use these headphones to watch TV late at night, and sometimes a kid will wear them when I don't feel like listening to a video game.  The headphones have never died on me, even after watching a couple of movies.  If the rechargeable battery ever stops holding enough of a charge I'm not worried - the batteries are standard AA rechargeable batteries so I can easily swap them out for new ones.The sound quality is very good.  They're comfortable  - I can watch a couple of movies in a row without discomfort.  The range is good, and recharging is a snap since the headphones charge while sitting on their cradle.  I've never experienced interference with these headphones (e.g. from a cordless phone or microwave oven).I do wish the controls (volume and tuning) were a little bigger.  If the sound source is muted after a bit you'll hear static in the headphones.  I believe that's a power-saving function, and when the source is unmuted the audio comes right back.As a bonus, I see you can now get the headphones by themselves (Sennheiser  HDR120 Supplemental HiFi Stereo Wireless Headphone for RS-120 Wireless System), so two people can listen to the same source at once.  That would be great for when the kids want to go head-to-head playing videogames.After 6 years I've certainly gotten my money's worth.

They are great for TV, our house is very peaceful! The earlier models (mostly plastic) suffered from difficult controls and brittle plastic causing premature breakage of the headarches. Fortunately, I dealt with the Good Guys (now defunct), who honored my purchased extended warranties without a hitch four times. Maybe that partially explains why they went out of business! The rechargeable batteries on my RS-45's finally died of old age, so I carefully studied Sennheiser's latest and finally selected the RS-120's. Best phones I ever got for the money. No problems whatsoever with installation and operation. Mine hiss only if I move too far away. I honestly do not understand what the low-rating cry babies are complaining about. Congratulations, Sennheiser!Here's a quick follow-up on the above:We are now in late May, 2011 and I had to replace the 3 RS120's due to old age. Got 2 new ones and clearly there have been significant improvements since 2006. These have a much better snug fit on the head; The control buttons seem to be slightly larger, making operation easier than before. I detect no hiss whatsoever, even if I move from the living room to the kitchen or office.Now the sad part: I sent Sennheiser an email several days ago, offering them my 3 old units at no charge for recycling or refurbishing.

They are great for my living situation which is not wanting to bother my neighbors as I have pretty thin walls in my apartment.

If I had to do it again I think I would have gone for the RS 170's. but I am very pleased with these. The sound is very good and full. Sennheiser has a great reputation and the price was hard to pass up but the extra $150 for the rs 170's may have been worth it.

They will not work. They also would not work on the jack on back of t.v. So thanks to comment by PriVick, I tried unplugging my sound system and using audio out on cable box and they worked. But now can't use my sound system. T.V. speakers on the LG flat screen are really bad. You have to turn up volume 100% to even hear the t.v. So now if we want to use the headphones, we have to settle for everyone else listening to t.v. speakers without surround sound system. Its not an ideal solution. Its only for the kitchen t.v. so I guess I'll keep them but will look elsewhere for our entertainment room t.v.Edit -I changed my original review after someone commented on my review which gave me instruction on how to get them to work. I now can give 3 stars because they work well and good quality sound. The instructions could be far better however.

Unlike some of the other comments, I have had nothing but crystal clear sound from the moment I turned them on. I have even gone outside with them a short distance from the house and the sound is still clear and that with the base unit stored in the cabinet underneath the TV. I seldom get any interference.

At this point in time, I have the base connected to the audio output connectors on the TV.There are only 2 issues I have. The more annoying one is the fit. With the Sennheiser name, I thought the fit would be better. They ""toe in"" toward the front of my head creating pressure points just in front of my ears. After wearing them for a short while, this becomes less noticible but it is still there. The second is a burst of static when I pause the Tivo receiver I have for a few moments. I normally get around this by just turning the headphones off when I'm not actually listening to something (I do the same when a commercial comes on and I'm watching Live TV). The on/off switch is getting a workout and we'll have to see how it holds up after a period of time. Of course, taking them off works pretty well too.Pros:. Clear sound/great reception.

However, as others have said, the base station shuts off if it doesn't detect audio. Well, if that were all it was, I would deal with it. However, when the base shuts off EVEN WHEN THERE IS audio, thus producing the ear drum shattering static, it becomes unacceptable! I use my wireless headphones on my computer to watch DVDs and online movies in bed and the base station will ""go out"" in the middle of a conversation; so I know there is audio. In order to get the base station to come on again, I have to get up, shut the headphones off, place them back on the cradle wait a couple of minutes, pick them up, turn them back on and MAYBE they will again be working. Unfortunately for me, I already threw the box away so I won't be returning them. However, I won't be wasting my money of Sennheiser products again and because I paid less than [...] for them, perhaps I got off lucky.The range is likewise less than optimal. I live in a 2-bedroom apartment (approx 1,000 sq ft). Static is heard while even in the same room as the base and if I walk into the kitchen from the bedroom... forget it; the static is so bad it becomes too difficult to understand the conversations taking place on the DVD I am attempting to listen to.I've never encountered the problem some have mentioned concerning the discomfort on the ear pads as I have not been able to keep them on my head long enough to see if the pads become uncomfortable.But other than that, these headphones are fine.

They do. Pros and cons. Pros you can hang the base on the wall within reach of your favorite source, be it your tv or stereo or whatever and in my case, I have a stereo in the basement and TV and receiver upstairs. The reason I mention this is because. I sometimes hook the set downstairs, put on some cd's or vinyl and sit on the porch and they sound fine (about 30 feet distance) When the wife goes to bed, I connect to the T.V upstairs and listen to the game (loud). It comes with 1/4 adaptor and it comes off leaving the 1/8 inch which fits most computers etc. It has an adjustment setting (3 way) on the base for best frequency and a dial on the headset to make it more clear. In some cases it takes a few minutes to get the settings right. Which brings the Con (or one of them) The volume control is directly above where you adjust the frequency settings so if you're not paying attention you can accidently adjust frequency when you want to turn the volume up. The only other con is (and it's only because it isn't in the manual) is this. If you adjust the headset (as in pull one side down to adjust for your head, You have to put both sides all the way back up before putting the headset on the base for charging. Now this should be obvious but I adjusted my headset and was jamming and dropped the headset. When I went to charge them it wouldn't sit straight on the stand and I thought I bent them by dropping them. I even started pulling the headset a little so it would sit even on the base. It wasn't until I started really looking at the headset on the base where I did the (duh) and walked over and pushed both earpieces up and set it back on the base. It was fine. These are really comfortable as well. These are definitely worth the price and I would buy again.

My sweetie wanted her TV in the kitchen area to be loud, I wanted it to be quiet so I could hear my TV. This is a pretty standard problem with open-space living and great-rooms.I decided that this would never be resolved until I acquired some headphones. I researched some wireless units and decided to go with the Sennheiser RS120 based on reviews here at Amazon. These headphones are perfect for TV listening. Note that they feature large,flat ear pads which are designed to spread ear pressure over a large area so you can listen comfortably for hours. Typical earphones with small pads or ""around the ear"" design can sometimes begin to hurt a bit after an hour or so. Not the case with these bad boys. I liked them so much I bought two more as Christmas gifts.In summary:PROS:* Great price here at Amazon* Easy hook-up* Charging cradle works well* Long lasting charge* Wireless reception works well and is adjustable. Good range, I can go outside on patio.* Sound quality is good.  I also use them for stereo music while I work in my shop.* Wife is happyCONS:* A bit of a sloppy fit on head. Can slide forward and fall off if you lean too far forward. Guys....be careful at the toilet.",1292630400

Then I moved to a new house and BAM, still hisses and whisp, but not bad enough to deal with RMA. THESE HEADPHONES ARE A GAMBLE depending on your location.There is a couple things you can do to reduce interference, but everything runs on wireless now-a-days, it's really hard to filter out all that for these headphones, but my best guess for the reason why they were so bad at my other place is because a station somewhere was broadcasting a powerful signal over my old house, making them hiss and whisp really bad.I don't know why so many people gave these 5 stars, I would haven't had them better than 4, but I guess people are easily impressed. There is a few problems with them:Cons:1.) Interference depending on your location (-2 stars)2.) Auto off switch3.)

Even within this challenging environment, these headphones sound good as long as I stay within 20 feet of the transmitter. Outside of that they slug it out with the others. Although as far away as 50 feet, I can settle down on my bed, taking care to hold my head still, and only occasionally hear a hissy-fit.Yea, the audio is pretty good although not excellent. Yea, they are distance challenged at least in my environment. But hey, they are nearly cheap and some of the best performing wireless headphones around. I'm keeping these until a new generation of perfect wireless headphones arrives, whenever that be. They definitely solve the problem of listening without disturbing others and give you some freedom to listen and roam.Be mindful that there are several adjustments to make. First, there is the channel selector on the included base unit. Secondly, there is a thumb wheel on the right side ear piece that fine tunes the signal.

They us FM modulation, circa 60s.  This manual nature of the RF interfaces surprised me and is not something I would expect in even 25 year old electronics.After 3 minutes of no audio input (e.g. turn off TV) a loud hiss/static commences on the headphones.  This means if you leave the headphone off the cradle and turn off the TV the headphone will hiss loudly until the battery dies.  The headphone should turn off as well....poor design.The charging cradle is a bit awkward to use in that if the earpieces are not set for equal length, then the headphone will tilt to one side and the conductors in the headset band will not sit flat on metal bars (you can see the bars in the picture) and the batteries will not charge.The ear pad foam is very light duty and I would not expect them to last 12 months with normal use and wear and tear.There are no RCA adapters included.The charging light stays lit even after charging is complete!Its awkward to plug in the power adapter.

This rig is no exception.They don't come right out and say that the little 3 position switch on the front of the transmitter( that is almost hidden)  allows selection of one of three channels and that rotating the tuning dial on the headphones allows you to 'tune in"" to the selected channel.When I first used my set the sound was terrible ( the switch comes set to Channel one. When I switch to channel 2 or 3 and re-tuned the sound was crystal clear and Spectacular !WARNING...be careful when you open the compartment for the batteries. DO NOT pry it or you'll break the plastic mounting tabs. It is opened by simply rotating the foam ear pad counter-clockwise about a quarter of an inch and voila ! off it comes.The batteries MUST be charged for this unit to work properly. If you're like me , you're impatient to try the unit out and don't want to wait for batteries to charge so what you can do is just install conventional alkaline batteries and put the rechargeable batteries ( that come with the unit)in an external charger if you have one.The alkalines will get you started immediately but WARNING! Do not put the phones in the charging cradle !!!  When your done playing around, put the rechargeables  back in the headphones then you can place it in the charging cradle .One last warning... the AC power 'brick' is in a little white box""hidden"" in the packaging. DO NOT throw out the packaging  until you find this device. I almost did.I read a lot of complaints about hissing and bad sound here.

I'm luvin'em.Forgot to add.... that because this device uses RF( radio frequency)  and not IR ( infrared light)it is like a mini FM radio station that allows you to plug it in any audio source and listen to it while your out in your yard doing whatever.

Then I saw the RS-120s on sale at Amazon and decided they seemed like the right quality at the right price. And I'm not disappointed. Like all wireless devices, you have to expect some interference now and then, but I am almost always able to ""tune"" these using a combination of the channel setting, the tuner, the volume on the phones and the volume at the source. The sound is excellent once you hit that sweet spot and not bad when you're just off. Of course, noises generated by your sound source (radio, CD or whatever) will be magnified when they're playing right in your head, and hisses and pops that you wouldn't necessarily notice coming from your loudspeakers become very apparent. So the better the source, the better the sound on these. And it matters where you place the sending unit -- put it too close to an electrical source (certain light bulbs, your amp and so on) might introduce extraneous noise, so move that around a bit to find a quiet spot. The headphones are light, comfortable and fit me well enough (contrary to complaints from some of the one-star reviewers). They are not ""sound-isolating"" -- which is fine, I still want to hear the phone and people's voices if they are talking to me.

Got these wireless headphones on discount at a local store. She loves them. Says sound is fuller than the TV Ears and voices easy to understand. Although only 2 channel, she says sound feels more surround than the Ears. Plus she says they are very comfortable for longer listening. They are flat against your ear with minimal pressure - doesn't go over ear or in the ear. So far no problems staying on as some reviewers mentioned. They are adjustable. She was also impressed that when she got up to go to the kitchen to get a snack, that she didn't miss any dialogue. Signal went through walls without any static.Before, I would have to turn the volume up for her to hear voices, and then turn it down during loud periods (explosions, etc.). Now I can set it at a normal level for me to hear voices and where loud parts aren't too loud. I also notice that she can hear me when I talk to her. When she wore the TV Ears, because they go inside of ear, she would have to remove from head in order to hear me -- made watching shows & movies less interactive.The transmitter stand can be positioned almost anywhere. The rechargeable headset rests on metal rack above transmitter. Very easy to set on rack and see the red charging light come on to verify they are charging. The TV Ears are a little more temperamental -- you place them in a charger and unless they are positioned just right to make contact with charger they won't charge.

They can be tuned into the TV properly with no fuzzy interference (at least in my house, where there is also wifi internet and wireless land lines), and get crystal clear reception. The range is pretty good too for walking around, and of course since it is not LED, the signal is not line of sight, so objects or a house wall or two can be in the way without hampering the sound. There is a volume and frequency knob on the phones themselves, so you don't have to get up and down traveling to the base to adjust either one. Everything can be done from your recliner.

The rechargeable battery has a very long life, as I have not had to replace it yet and have had the phones a few years now.That said, I don't know who designed the way they sit on your head, but if I try to walk around with them, say to go to the kitchen for a snack while I am listening to a show, they slide off my head too easily. In fact, I cannot look down at all (like into the sink, or into a silverware drawer) or they slide forward and right off. They are large and somewhat heavy, but it's the way the overhead band is curved or contoured that causes the problem. Maybe the newest ones have been re-designed, but if they allowed me to walk around just a little they'd get 5 starts.Even so I would buy another pair. I like them that much.",1333756800

There is a light hiss while I'm wearing them, but that is standard for any pair of wireless headphones and I am used to it now.It is not generally disruptive and I can distinguish it from other hiss (e.g. hiss in audio that I am editing). If I want to do extremely serious audio editing, I check it on a pair of wired headphones or monitors.I have a small head, and a lot of headphones do not get small enough for me.

These provide an extended use time between charging.  The steel frame cradle for the headphones acts as the charging point..One caveat: the base station has to be plugged into a 120VAC power source in order to operate, and that means that the base station is meant to be fixed and stationary, with an audio cable connected between the base and audio source. The base station is paired to the headphones.  So, this setup is best used as a localized, single point system.

I find the sound of these to be very good and I do not have a problem with interference. BUT they are completely frustrating!First of all, they constantly slide off my head. It was so bad that I thought I had a stretched headset, and convinced Sennheiser to send me a replacement. The replacement is just as bad. Don't expect to use this if you plan to be moving around in the slightest. I'm not a head-banger by any means, but even bobbing your head to the music is a challenge.The second problem is that they often, for no reason, flat out refuse to play. The on/off light stays off despite them being plugged in and powered on. I have to go through gyrations with the power cord until they decide to start working. I'm not even sure if my fiddling with the cord does anything or if it is just random. Because of the replacement I received, I ended up with a second base unit and transformer, and I have had the problem with both bases and both transformers.Lastly, the auto-shut-off is very annoying. Often I will pause my music to have a conversation with someone and in the middle of the conversation I will get a blast of static noise in my ear when the transmitter turns off.Edited 11/13/09: I am still using these headphones 2.5 years after I wrote this original review, so they must not be as bad as I originally wrote. really, the sound is good, and they are very comfortable. I have not had the refusing to play problem lately, so I'm not sure what was going on there. I have moved them a few times since I was having that problem, so perhaps it was just bad location.

The design is absolutely wonderful--it's obviously Sennheiser did their homework on design and the base is very cute and functional.With that, I'd like to add some negatives that some of the other reviews, may or may not have mentioned.1) There IS a noticable hissing sound at pauses/low volume music/movies.  No way to get around this.2) The headphones are designed to be FLAT and not ones that surround your ear. However, they are much more comfortable than my Sennheiser HD497s, but noticably less comfortable than my HD590s.3) The bass is REALLY lacking on these headphones. Please don't believe what any of the other reviewers are saying. I am no audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, but the bass is almost non-existant.  The highs and mids are great, but the bass needs work!############ AMAZON USER WARNING #############4) The unit DOES come with an adapter, but the design of the splitter makes it INCOMPATIBLE with most Logitech speaker headphone ports and (some) Dell laptop computers. You may have to go out and buy another one from radio shack!I thought about returning them, but every time I look at them and think about wireless music, I change my mind!@@@@@@@@ WARNING @@@@@@@@@@:AMAZON HAS RAISED THE PRICE BACK TO $99 from $69!Be warned!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@",1134086400

Laake ""camera nerd""",A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5,"I rely upon wireless headphones to watch TV while the misses is asleep, and these get the job done, but surprisingly I found much better options available to gamers.  While I do play an occasional video game, I don't ever use a microphone or anything while I play, so I never considered one of them until I started hearing good things about the digital wireless headsets available. When I tried one, I was blown away compared to the hissing found in these old school 900MHz analog models. Do yourself a favor and considerEarForce X31 Headset (Refurbished), which cost marginally more ($58 as a refurb when I type this) and offer better comfort and much clearer sound. You have to hear the sound to believe it. Just put the microphone out of the way and call it a day. They run off of 2.4GHz and use a WiFi signal, so if you have a router nearby (which can cause issues), splurge on theTurtle Beach Ear Force X32 Digital Headsetwhich adds the 5GHz frequency. Either are so much better than these. Sennheiser makes great headphones, and these aren't that. They're wireless tech is lacking, and even if you take the hiss and other issues out of the equation, there just not that comfy nor is the sound (ignoring the hiss) that good.

"10 15, 2009","[2, 2]",4.0,Works for Watching TV at Night,B0001FTVEK,"Shannon Hennigan ""Shannon222""",A3BTD37XCXCVEF,"I struggled with which headphones to buy to watch TV at night so my spouse can sleep. Every time I read reviews I got overwhelmed and gave up. I'm happy that I finally settled on these Sennheisers, because they do just what I needed them to do at reasonable price.I'm very satisfied with these headphones.They fit okay. Although they are not what I'd classify as ""comfortable"", I don't wear them for more than a couple of hours a night, so they are acceptable. They do get hot on my ears when it's warm in the room. I tried a pair of TV Ears before and they are painful to wear, so these are MUCH more wearable than those were. I wish these had cup design so that they wouldn't slip around so much on my head when I move, the smooth ear covers can slip and slide.These headphones are extremely easy to put on the charging stand.The only time I hear hissing or static is when I first put them on and I haven't started the TV yet. If the TV is on pause when I first put the headphones on, there is static. After I start watching TV, I can pause without any noise. If there is static once I start to watch, all I need to do is turn the lower dial and tune in the headphones and no more problem.I have a little trouble with the way the dials are set up, because it's easy to turn the wrong one. When I want volume, I might accidentally tune the headphones in the wrong direction and lose my clear sound. Easy to fix, but I'd rather not have to think about it. I also would like an easy on off switch. This one is tiny and a little hard to move.I completely recommend these headphones to people who want to watch TV without disturbing others. I can hear most other sounds in the room even with the headphones in use. There is some sound leakage but it doesn't bother my spouse at all. (I use these with a 52"" Sony Bravia LCD TV. I turn off the separate sound system to use the headphones.)",1255564800
"07 5, 2013","[0, 0]",4.0,Work very well for TV watching,B0001FTVEK,sharkychick,A2EDWI5EGP4V9N,"First of all, as to sound quality, I want to make it clear that I purchased these for television watching, not listening to music.  I needed something wireless for tv because I have severe tinnitis and sometimes have to crank the tv way up and still miss a lot of the sounds and dialogue.  I have other Sennheiser headphones and earbuds that I love for music.So, that said, the sound is excellent for my use.  I have not a single complaint in terms of the sound.  They give me more and better sound than I could have ever expected.  I cannot believe how much stuff I was missing on my tv shows!They are NOT noise-cancelling headphones, so be sure you know that when you are shopping.  If you want noise-cancelling headphones you will not want these.The range seems perfectly good.  I have the unit located somewhat centrally in my large-ish house and I can walk all over the house and outside without interference.  They do not interfere with my phones or home network.  You want to make sure that is something you take into account.  My phones are the 6.0 Dect technology and my home network is 2.4ghz, so these are on a completely different frequency.I was glad that they came with an adapter for the 'audio output' port on my Sony 42' living room television because the red and black plugs didn't work with the red/white outputs.  So, you need to make sure you have the correct outputs.  The adapter turns the red/black plugs into a single 3.5mm headphone type plug.They have a large-to-small hole (slip the nail or screw in the larger part and slide the unit down where the hole gets smaller so it won't fall out) on the back of the charger unit for hanging convenience.  I actually had this unsightly bolt coming out of this brick wall piece and it hangs perfectly on that.  I rather like that better than trying to find something to set it on top of and not worry about somebody knocking it off.  Then, the headphones just sit atop the frame for charging. The way the cradle is designed they stay securely atop the charging unit.You get plenty of battery time, per charge.  When I first got these I kept track of time just so I could not have any surprises.  I got to over ten hours and got bored with that, so I haven't tested them out beyond that.  For over ten hours of use, I had plenty of charge.Now, for my one issue - and it's not a total dealbreaker, but just an annoyance - The shape of the over-the-head part is a little bit on the squarish side.  I have, I guess, a normal size female head so 99.9% of all over-the-head headphones fit me perfectly in the smallest position.  These are kind of square-ish over the top.  So, while they fit nicely and feel comfortable, if I bend over they will fly right off my head.  They don't feel really loose or anything, but I think it's just that the shape of the over-the-head band (or whatever you'd call it) is less rounded than others I have.  I have a pair of Sennheiser (wired) HD555 headphones I use for music and they are absolutely perfect in fit.  I wish these were shaped more like that.But, I just got used to it because these are otherwise perfect for me for watching television.  Beyond that they are very comfortable - nice and cushy on the ears and I wear glasses.  The band adjusts out for larger heads, like all other headphones I've ever had.",1372982400

Have enjoyed good range from them, walls don't make a big difference but then I'm not an audiophile and tend not to use these for music. Since I have both - I can easily switch either headset to either source transmitter. Currently 1 of my sources is linked to my receiver's zone 2 output - so I can listen to all my input hooked to it and in case either headset runs out of battery I can quickly switch over to the other one.I use it for listening to the news (radio or tv). I am extremely happy with my purchases, though the fit could be better it does make me think that perhaps if the fit was tighter I would not find them as comfortable. The battery charge (RS110 uses batteries) lasts a while as do the inbuilt batteries in the RS120, it helps that I can recharge batteries for both headsets.Well worth the purchase for me and the flexibility is much welcomed.",1304294400

"10 19, 2008","[5, 5]",4.0,Treadmill headphone shopper?,B0001FTVEK,SMB,A3PN0EVA1YE8A3,"If you are looking for a headphone set to watch television while you walk on a treadmill, this review is for you.  I have not tested this product with a stereo.I told myself to wait a few weeks before writing this review as I've only used it twice, but I can always update later if the headphones start acting up.  I just bought this on Oct 10th and paid $59.50 for it.  Before the headphones reached my door on Oct 16th Amazon jerked the price up ten bucks.  I probably wouldn't have made the purchase at the new price--the extra ten bucks would have been the difference between the maybe and I don't know I was experiencing when trying to decide about buying it.They need to knock that ten bucks right back off for the simple reason that the product totally lacks basic instructions.  You can go to the manufacturer's website, sennheiser dot com, and look at a PDF file of the actual instructions that come in the box with the product.  What you see is what you get.  It comes in nine different languages in a strip about two inches wide for each language.If you have a newer TV set and/or newer DVD player with multiple RCA output connections you won't have any problems.  (Unfortunately both my TV and DVD player were older models)As Amazon has raised the price of these, if you can find another RF (radio frequency) wireless headphone set at a cheaper price, you'd probably do just as well with those as this particular set.  The key is to get a wireless RF headset and NOT an infrared headset.  Wireless infrared headphones do not work with treadmills.  Treadmills interrupt the infrared frequencies.  So this review is more reporting on how RF headphone products work, indeed this particular product as it is the only one I've tried, but I imagine other RF headphones work equally well.The two times I've used it so far, it has worked fantastic.  I only watch DVDs while I walk on my treadmill so I have the headset's transmitter plugged directly into my DVD player.  (I had to switch out my old player with a newer model from the living room that had multiple RCA outputs)  I can turn down the TV volume to zero and turn up the headphones so loud they will almost knock me off the treadmill! (yeah, I turned it back down some)I think I read a review somewhere online about this product where the reviewer said their television still had to be at about mid volume in order for the product to work--maybe that reviewer had the receiver connected to their television, whereas I have mine connected to my DVD player.  As the manufacturer is silent regarding everything on the product, who knows, I can only tell you that I can turn my TV down to zero and the headphones cannot be at full volume without busting my eardrums.I hope this helped other treadmill headphone shoppers save some of the hours I spent looking for a headphone set.I only gave the product four stars because the manufacturer failed to provide a basic manual with the product and the quality of earphones themselves is a bit on the cheap side.",1224374400

I know it's not a problem with my audio port because I have wired earbuds and have no such issues.Then, you have the headphones that are so heavy that if I tilt my head down they slip off my head and fall.Then, the signal quality is certainly just sub-prime.

On Christmas morning I took them out of the box, very simply connected the two wires into the back of the Television and plugged the charger into the wall. I thought I'd figure it all out when we got home from the Family Dinner.That evening I put on the headset wondering how difficult it was going to be to set it all up and was amazed to find that it was already working. I had anticipated a complicated kind of nightmare involving the menu on the television (of which the original remote has long since disappeared..) but no, this was a hundred times easier than I expected. There was no set up procedure. Just put it on and go. So, once I got over that pleasant surprise, I discovered the fantastic sound quality. I even listened to the absolute rubbish they were playing on MTV just to check out the surround sound feel of it all. Amazing. I've watched a couple of movies that I've seen before and I was surprised to hear all kinds of extra comments and sounds that I didn't hear the first time around. I'm definitely buying a set of these for my Father-in-law as he wears a hearing aid and would really appreciate the many benefits they would have to offer him. If I had to fault them, then there are only two small aspects, and they might be peculiar to me, I don't know. I find if I bend over while wearing them, they will slip off my head. The other thing is that, after wearing them for about five or six hours, my left ear begins to ache a little. I think that both of these problems are due to the fact that you cannot adjust the width of the headset, only the height. But they're still great. I just hold onto them when I'm brushing my teeth and make sure to adjust them forward a bit if I feel my ear begin to ache. Finally, another great thing is how easy it is to recharge them. When I'm finished for the evening, I just sit them back on the cradle, and that wire touches off a pair of exposed metal strips in the headband part and hey presto, the charging light comes straight on, no messing about.

"01 2, 2014","[1, 1]",4.0,Made a hearing impaired friend very happy!,B0001FTVEK,Stephan S.,A1DLXO4Y5TOSXJ,"These were purchased for a friend who has hearing issues. He had lost the ability to hear movies and TV without having the volume to a point that kept his family awake at night. This little unit fixed that issue.Here are a few points that I was a bit foggy on until purchasing these headphones.Connections - the base unit has left and right RCA audio plugs that go into your TVs &#34;audio out&#34;. It includes adapters for 3.5mm and 1/4&#34; connections.Sound - since you're using the &#34;audio out&#34; on your TV sound will always go to the headphones. That way others in the room can listen to the TV at a normal level allowing the person using the headphones to turn it up as much as they need. Or at night you can turn the TV sound all the way down and just use the headphones to make sleeping for the family easier.Charging - the headphones have built in contacts that match up to the wire holder. When you place the headphones on the holder the &#34;charging&#34; light comes on.Reception - as others have stated, standing close to the base unit results in static. You have the ability to swap channels on the base unit and there is a tuning knob on the headphones that allows you to fine tune them to be static free.Quality - very good sound reproduction that results in clear and rich listening.Overall my friend was amazed at how much he'd been missing. Now he can hear everything while watching TV. He's also able to watch movies again, something he'd missed very much but stopped doing because he couldn't hear half the movie. That's not an issue anymore.",1388620800

By 10:00 each evening, I bring out the headphones. Actually, I look forward to wearing them. The sound is so clear and they cut out all of the extraneous sound that we become used to trying to filter with our brains (e.g. dogs barking, sirens from passing first responders, children playing in the neighborhood, etc.).The sound coming through the headphones is so clear that it is not necessary to have the volume as high as when using the television speakers. Since the headphones are wireless, I can exit the room and stay up with the dialogue while I'm popping the popcorn or grabbing a drink. I have found so many perks to having the headphones!! I think I'm going to purchase a set of headphones for my dad for Father's Day!  He is hard of hearing, but cannot disturb the neighbors in his apartment building. He can use the headphones while my mom uses the regular speakers at a lower volume. Problem solved!  Recently, he asked me about headphones and whether they are difficult to connect.

I can turn my home theater and the tv sound completely down, and just listen with the headphones. (Plugged into the RCA red/black OUT connection on back of Samsung plasma tv). I think the weight is ok, not too heavy, and I like the volume and on/off switch on them. They recharge overnight, never have used up all the battery juice so far.

They have a tuning and a volume control on the right side ear muff and an on/off switch on the left.  They are very comfortable for extended wear.  I can wear them anywhere around the house, upstairs and down without any loss of signal and have been outside as far as 200 feet and still hear the program but the further away the signal does get weaker with distance.  The headphone rechargeable batteries are automatically charged when they are placed on the base and a red light on the base indicates they are being charged.  When the TV is on a green light on the base indicates there is a signal.  Hookup was effortless, just plug  the transformer into a power outlet and connect the signal cable and it works.  If the tuner is not on the channel, a turn of the tuning knob will get the signal and then it can be left alone.  There is plenty of volume for those hard of hearing, like me, and the sound is excellent.There is only one negative side to these phones.  The muffs are covered with cloth and are flat.  Very comfortable, however a turn of the head to look down and they will easily fall off my head.  I highly recommend this for anyone needing hearing help for TV watching.",1378425600
"12 14, 2010","[2, 2]",5.0,Housework soooo much easier!,B0001FTVEK,"StillWater ""StillWater""",A16ZPISSA8J43S,"When hubby was at work, I would often turn on a computer radio program to listen to while I did housework. Unfortunately, he was seriously injured at work almost 2 years ago. His sleep is erractic and pain makes the only place sleep is possible, is his recliner. Since I never know when he will be able to sleep, I stopped listening to the programs I had enjoyed, so it wouldn't bother him. My brother suggested I check out wireless headphones. He told me a very little bit, but mostly look for the kind that were wireless and not line of sigth, in other words the kind that could go through walls, ceilings, etc. So, I started researching and reading. I thought I would just pick up a pair at Best Buy or even Walmart. Well, the ones they both carried didn't have great write ups nor were they any cheaper than these Sennheiser RS120's from Amazon's seller Electronic Expo. Obviously, cost is important with out current situation. I'd never heard of Sennheiser. Left to buy by brand, I would have bought something familiar like Sony, but I kept reading good things about Sennheiser on every site I checked. The price was as good or better than the brands I had heard before. So I did rely heavy on the comments of others - thanks to you who posted. I am not an audiophile or techie at all.So now you know why I bought them, on to the headphones and how they work. In one word - excellent! I love, love, love them! I put them on and listen to the computer radio programs as I do housework and they don't disturb hubby from sleeping. Finally, once again I can enjoy what I want, when I want. I have only had them a month or so but I use them almost everyday from 1-2 hours, to all day long because they are compfortable enough to wear for hours, if I choose. Yeah, the ears will get a little warm but really not bad at all since they are not cupped over them. What little sound may escape doesn't bother hubby as I am not setting beside him when I use them and I doubt they would do so even then, because I don't have anything that close to my ears blasting. I have worn them out to the garage to load my truck with some things, out to the end of the house to the garbage can and even down to the end of the driveway which is about 175' long. I never lost my signal. I did get white noise louder than my signal only once and that was when I pushed the garbage can over to the side of the drive and I was underneath a powerline transmitter - duh - no surprise there was some interference there. But, obviously it only lasted a the few seconds it took to leave the garbage can there and then as I stepped away, the signal was clear again. My house is a ranch house, 65' long. The computer and headphones transmitter are literally on one end of it in the dining room we use as an office. The entire house and full length basement recieve a signal just fine. When I walk through a doorway, I occasionally get a little hiss or white noise mixed into the voices, but only passing through the doorway. The rest of the time is perfect. Performance is A+ for me.To be honest, I have not hooked them up to the TV nor Stereo, but all of the plugs you need to do so are included. I can say that on the radio talk shows I listen to they do occasionally play music coming on, going off, commercial breaks etc, and it sounds great. So, I am sure listening to CD's would only be better.If there are any negatives it would be the inability to tighten them just a little more. Thanks to reviews by others I was aware of this before purchase, however, I wasn't intending to use them for exercise so it didn't matter. It still isn't a big issue. I am only 5'2"" and have a pretty small head. Adjusted to the smallest size works well for almost every thing I do. If I am running the dust mop and bend over to pick up the cat's toy they are fine and don't move. Once I was bent over for a while as I was pulling out everything from the closet floor to clean in there and they slipped around. Not off, just off center of the ear. Had I not stopped and repositioned them, I suppose they could have fallen but it was not that big of a deal. I did find that a little of my hair had gotten between the headphones and my ear. If I make sure all my hair is pulled back before positioning the headphones on the ear they stay put better. I guess a cup style wouldn't matter but these do, so if you have long hair, make sure it is all out from between the headphones and ear.The only other thing I could say that it was lacking was better instructions. I may not be an audiophile but I figured out how to hook everything up simply by looking at it. I did learn things from posts however, I wouldn't have known otherwise. For instance, I received them, let them charge overnight and then when I tried them the sound quality was not good. There was a LOT of noise even close to the transmitter. From the review posts I had read, I was aware of the tuning button below the volume control which tuned in the signal. I didn't see anything in the packaging about that! Had I not known, I would have been dissappointed in the product. Knowing about it beforehand was great, I simply tuned in the signal and I was off to housework - happily once again.In conclusion, I cannot compare these to other wireless models, they are my first ones. But, I am VERY happy and for $59, I feel it was well worth my money. I would highly reccommend these to anyone.",1292284800

I can actually hear better with the headphones not wearing my hearing aids than  listening to the TV with just my hearing aids using the surround speakers with no headphones on. I have only one negative to say about the Sennheiser RS120, it has a tendency to slide on my head a bit. If I make sure they are positioned well there is no problem. The other headphones I own are Sony  RF970. The negative for them is that the phones not only automatically shut off when not using, but they often shut off when you readjust their position on your head or just move your head. This is especially  a problem if you are lying down. They also do not have the clarity of the Sennheiser RS120. The Sony phones still sound very good, but not as good as the Sennheiser.

"11 25, 2012","[9, 9]",4.0,Great function and versatality,B0001FTVEK,thomasterrible,A2WYCJOJY6QSJI,"I got these wireless headphones primarily so that I can listen to audio at night and not disrupt my girlfriend when she is trying to sleep.  They have worked out wonderfully for this purpose.I have liked other Sennheiser products in the past so I thought I would give these a try.  I should mention that I got these refurbished for under $60.00.  You can purchase a new pair of the RS110 wireless headphones and get the same thing but without one feature I consider important, not having the rechargeable batteries.  Even if you were to install rechargeable batteries on the RS110 model they would not have the ability to be charged by just resting them on the cradle of the transmitter this set has.  That is worth the difference to me right there.  So far I have not needed to change channel settings to get a clear signal so whether it is worth the extra money for the RS120 is difficult to say.  Perhaps if one has a 900MHZ cordless phone it might be a more useful feature to have the ability to change channels to avoid that interference.  There is a cordless 900MHZ phone in my home but it is upstairs away from where I use these and I have not had any issues from it.  It may be a better buy to get the RS110 headphones if you don't need the multiple channels.These headphones have a transmitter which has a small AC adapter that plugs in to the wall to provide power to the base unit which is the transmitter and charger for the batteries located inside the headphones.  The headphones themselves use a pair of AAA rechargeable batteries that are installed by removing one of the foam pads from the headphones to uncover them.  The ear pads come off with a twist to gain access to the batteries and I suppose if ever needed to replace the pads themselves if ever worn out.SOUND: I get very clear sound through these.  I have a home theater which is my primary use for them so I can watch TV or other content on my home theater at night. I have a very nice surround speaker set up and while I do notice a difference between a high end multiple speaker system with a powered subwoofer it is not anything that is an annoying transition to what these are capable of putting out.The ad talks about ""Bass Response"" as a feature however there is no ""Bass Boost"" or other way to increase bass on these other than to increase it at the source you have them plugged in to.  The frequency response is 22Hz to 19500Hz and so that is a typical full range of sound although I have noticed some other wireless headphones with slightly lower frequency response such as 20Hz.  I have however played music of various varieties through these and have not had any issues.  I am a musician and like to listen to music and have no issues with the sound from these.  That said if someone absolutely has to have really high amounts of bass these might not be able to deliver that.  For me from TV programming or movies to music I am perfectly happy with the sound from these.  I was only willing to spend so much and do not feel the need to have more than these can deliver and have no plans of saving up for a higher end set.There is a small wheel on one side of the headphones to adjust the volume level on the headphones so you don't have to adjust the volume from the source once they are in use.  Next to that is another adjustment for frequency, this is to tune the headphones in for clarity just as one would do with an analog radio. Once I have done this I have not experienced any static at all.  Even when the headphones are turned on and there is no sound coming through them I do not hear any hiss as some have said they experience.  No complaints on sound of this system from me.COMFORT: I find these very comfortable for wearing for long period of time.  They have flat foam that covers ones ears, I far prefer this to having something going inside my ear or even smaller headphones that rest inside the ear (those types with 1/2 inch or so foam).  As I use these at night and end up often falling asleep I do not wake up with any ear pain which is great.  These are also very lightweight and do not put pressure on the sides of my head from too much tension yet stay on just fine.SOUND ISOLATION: These headphones do not have any fancy noise isolation or noise cancelling functions to them.  They also do not have over the ear surrounds to help seal them to your ears.  This is not an issue for me but it does mean that one could potentially have to turn up the volume on these headphones to overcome any other unwanted sound in the surrounding environment.  Again not an issue for me at all, I could hear someone talking or even like right now I can hear myself typing on the keyboard.  None of that is an issue for me, I have them at pretty low volume and if I wanted would turn them up if I was annoyed.  What environment you are in when using your headphones will dictate what features you might want to have if you don't want to hear any other sounds and have the volume low at the same time.VERSATILITY:  These work great for me for all my uses.  The transmitter comes with RCA connectors which one would use for things like the audio out from a TV or other device that does not have a headphone jack.  The set also comes with an adapter that plugs in to those and turns it in to a full size ""phono"" plug, the type of connector that large headphones are usually plugged in to.  Then one can pull the large phono jack off to reveal a 3.5mm jack which is what one uses for things like smartphones or most computers or other smaller devices.  So this set up comes with what you need to hook them up to most any device you want to hear audio from.CHARGING:  The transmitter or base part of the unit has large metal holders on top where you hang the headphones when not in use.  There are metal contacts on the inside top of the headphone head strap that when touching the wire metal holder on the base unit charge the batteries in the headphones.  There is a red charging light as well as a green on light on the base transmitter unit.  This is very convenient.  There is also a on/off switch on the headphones themselves so one can turn them off when not in use if you happen to not put them on the charger and avoid risking having the batteries run down. The claimed amount of time the headphones can operate between charges is stated at 20-25 hours.  I have not used them long enough without putting them on the charger to find that out for sure yet.The set does come with a pair of NiMh rechargeable AAA batteries which should last a long time taking many charges.  If you do have to replace them ever just remember to get a pair of rechargeable ones.  These will work if you install regular non-rechargeable AAA batteries which one might do in a pinch but if one does so they should remember that one should not attempt to recharge them.RANGE: These operate off radio frequency (the 900MHZ range) and like any radio signal is designed to easily go through walls and most structures.  I live in a 3 story house and have found that range to be pretty accurate.  There is the occasional short burst of static if I am walking though the house wearing them but I rarely have need to do that.INTERFERENCE: Again I only have one other specific 900MHZ item to deal with in the house.  I do however have loads of home theater and computer equipment in the main room I use them in as well as a large air cleaner unit and do not hear interference from any other devices.So I am very happy with this headphone system. For music do they sounds as good as my really expensive over ear Sennheiser headphones with are corded? No. But those are both not wireless and a LOT more expensive and these still have very acceptable quality sound.  Do these have great sound isolation from hearing any other outside noise? No, but in my case there is not a bothersome noisy environment I have to contend with.  If one wishes to have higher fidelity and or better noise isolation or even noise cancelling then perhaps another set of headphones is going to be necessary to fill those requirements.  For me however these have worked out perfect.  Again I paid under $60 for a refurbished set. I have no regrets and have no trouble recommending these just as long as the noise isolation/cancellation feature is not mandatory.",1353801600

Somebody mentioned that he was getting interference from a treadmill.  That made me worry a bit because that was the main reason I bought this.  This never happened to me (so far). I think it has to do with the type of motor used.  I would not be surprised if a hair dryer or a vacuum cleaner causes interference.I am quite happy with the sound quality.  I am getting more high and low frequencies compared to what I hear from the TV's main speakers.  I am sure it would be even better if I connect it to my home theater system.  For $70, I am totally satisfied with its sound quality.  I am just waiting to see how long this quality lasts and how soon the batteries will go bad (stop taking charge).  Although, these standard AAA batteries are a big plus, because they are cheaper to replace.A minor complain I have is charging the headphones.

The cable has turned brittle over the years and has cracked open in several places (especially in the areas that has been folded).  At first I thought that it was because I caught it on something, but it's all over the entire cord!  With this problem, I reduced my review to 3 stars.Blows out my Sony MDR-IF240RK which cost more!I've been very frustrated with the Sony model that I've had for a couple of months due to static noise.  I've tried everything from moving the base unit as far away as possible from the TV and other elctronic equipment (using a long Audio extension cord), to putting the darn thing next to me beside the couch.  No dice, it only works with the volume turned down very low.After reading reviews on wireless headsets, I was convinced that ALL OF THEM had massive amounts of static and I was very hesitant to buy another.  However, the Sony was driving me crazy! .. and wife insisted that I wear headphones at night while I watch my action DVD flicks and the loud (room shaking) booms that comes with them.I saw this on Amazon, and after reading all the good reviews .. I decided .. what the heck .. if I didn't like them, I could always return for a refund or excange.  Amazon has been very good to me in this manner, and of course that's why I keep coming back to them.  LOL, between my wife and I .. we must own a piece of Amazon by now.To make a long story short, I am pretty amazed by the quality of this unit.  The sound is excellent and I can go anywhere in the house, in the garage, outside and the sound is as clear as a bell .. and most of all, no annoying static.A little clarification:  You WILL get static if it's turned on and there's no sound source feeding it.  In other words, you must start your DVD player, CD Player, TV or whatever, before turning on the headset!Why only 4 stars?  Same complaint as the other folks who said that the headset was bulky (yup) and they don't fit quite snugly around the head.  I guarantee, it's not one for laying on your side because it's not too kind on the neck.  Also, I guess I have a pretty small head and I really have to fiddle around to adjust it so that it doesn't fall off.The ear pieces could be designed a bit better, maybe just by using a thicker and softer concaved material so that it completely surrounds the ears.  Perhaps they didn't want to make it even bulkier, but it sure would make it more snug fitting and comfortable.  I would be willing to spend an extra $20.00 to have this feature because the unit is that good!The bottom line is that this is definitely a KEEPER, inspite of the minor irritation of getting the headset on the head just right and the bulkiness.THIS JUST ADDED: (April 17th) after the initial review.I was unhappy with the earpiece that came with the unit so I did some modifications.  Ahhh, much improved!I had an old Kloss headset that had some very nice and comfortable earpads, soo.. I removed the pads from the Kloss (they were just lightly glued on to the ear piece plate), and exchanged it with the Sennheiser.  The Sennheiser earpieces goes on and off easily.  They just twist off and on, and the pads aren't even glued on to the plastic ear plate. There is a thin foam cusion that just lays against the plastic plate and a cloth that works like a fitted sheet that slips over the foam pad and the lip of plastic ear piece.I took the existing thin foam pad out of the Sennheiser and replaced it with the contoured THICK pad from the Kloss.  Then I slipped the cloth back over it twisted the ear pieces back on the headgear and I was off and running.  Took maybe 15 min.The contour and size of the Kloss earpieces are almost exactly identical to that of the Sennhiser so that made the job much easier.  The hardest part was removing the (glued on) foam pads off the Kloss earpieces.  But with the extra thickness of the new pads, it fits quite snuggly.  Cool!Note:  You can probably just buy some thick foam from your local Home Depot and just cut out an extra layer using the earpiece plate of the Sennhiser as your template.  Then place the extra foam on top of the other, and slip the cloth cover over both of them.  You should have a more comfortable, better fitting headset.",1145145600

It is also great when my mom comes over and starts talking none stop, I just put it on. The way it made that I can still hear my wife when she talks to me, but I don't know it a good thing or not Ha Ha. The only 2 things that I don't like is 1. There is not bass adjustment2. I look kind of big my head, the hard plastic curve around my head make me look like one of those Japanese pilot actor in the Gozara movie.

I have the transmitter attached to the analog audio out of my flat screen TV.  I have no 'sound system' attached to the overall setup, so all sound comes through the TV speakers.  What this allows me to do is to have both the sound come out of the TV speakers, and be simultaneously listening through the headphones.  That way, I can get the headphones on my wife who has some trouble hearing clearly, while I listen to the TV speakers.  It works just fine, the 3-star rating is for lots of little things.  The over-ear headphones are slightly unstable on the head - if you bend your head forward, they tend to move.  The Transmitter/receiver pair requires that you &#34;tune&#34; the sound from the transmitter as it enters the headphones, using an adjustment wheel on the headphone.  Pain in the rear.  And the wheel is located RIGHT below the volume control wheel, meaning it's easy to bungle as you try to adjust the volume while it's on your head.Distance is not a problem (25 feet seems OK, even through walls), the sound quality is good enough for TV, better than the TV speakers.Also ordered HDR120, which is the headphones-only, and they work just fine with the RS120 transmitter.Overall quality is adequate on all the parts.I think they're a bit pricey, but they do work as advertised, and are working for me in the way I desire.",1366588800

It seems that every time we have company over, my wife likes to sit in the dining area with the women and us guys like to sit and watch TV.  Problem is, the women have the tendency of talking over the TV volume.  I then raise the TV volume, then they start talking even louder.  Then I raise the volume ... A vicious cycle.While I expected some interference, being it uses radio waves, I was impressed that it is minimal.  You have a dial on the right head set that you must tune in the head set to.  If you experience significant interference (which I didn't)you have a slide switch on the base to select one of three channels, so the anti-static noise options are built-in.The head phone are very light weight and fit great.  As for the sound, I've never heard stereo so well.  Wow, what was I missing for years!Charging is a charm.  With the (replaceable) rechargeable batteries, you just hang them on the base for a charge.  I'd estimate that a full charge lasts at least 20 or so hours of continuous use.  I've never really timed it, so it is only a vague estimate.Finally, for the others watching TV, I ordered extra headsetsSennheiser  HDR120 Supplemental HiFi Wireless Headphone for RS-120 System (charging/transmitter base not included)so they could enjoy TV also, in spite of the environmental noise.What can I say?  If you need a wireless headphone, this is a great buy.Update! Almost Two years later and they're still working great.

"11 21, 2010","[1, 1]",4.0,All Hail Cordless Headphone Freedom,B0001FTVEK,"Vincent E. Martin ""Darkbard""",A3QMJMTLJC34QC,"Pros: Light weight; great aural frequency response; quality sound reproduction; easy set-up.Cons: Some RF interference from other accessories on my desktop.Bottom-Line: If you are in need of quality wireless headphones you could do a lot worse than the Sennheiser RS-120.As I stated in my Logitech MX3200 Cordless Desktop review, I dislike clutter.  And my desk at work is configured such that the keyboard, mouse and headphone cords run across the desktop and not only create an eyesore, but also get in the way of work.  So I had to find a solution.  I decided to go wireless; i.e. wireless keyboard, mouse and headphones.  The first device I purchased was the aforementioned Logitech Cordless Desktop MX-3200, which mates a wireless keyboard with a wireless MX-600 laser mouse.  The second purchase was a set of Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless (stereo) Headphones.The Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless Headphones are designed for use with Hi-Fi audio, television, or computer.  The open air RF (radio Frequency) German-made headphones are designed to provide a rich palate of aural sound (frequency response rated at 22Hz - 19500Hz) through walls as well as ceilings allowing one to roam throughout the house while listening to your tunes.Power to the headphones is provided by a set of NiMH (size AAA) batteries.  These batteries are in turn recharged by putting the headphones on their transmitter base; said base can be mounted to a wall. The entire system--transmitter base and headphones weigh in at just 8.1 ounces, but the headphones are rather large; large but comfortable.The transmitter can be set to three different channels, while a rotary dial is provided on the headphone to fine tune the pair.  An on/off switch and volume control can also be found on the headphones.Set-up & UseI bought the Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless Headphones to use on my computer at work to replace my bulky speakers, but I tested the unit at home first on my home stereo system.  It took me less than five minute to set the system up.  The transmitter base is fitted with two LED's: a yellow On/Off and red Charge lights.  Once the transmitter and plugged into an audio source and detects current the On/Off LED will illuminate.  Once I installed the batteries in the headphones I was ready for wireless listening.In and around my house the sound quality from the Sennheiser RS-120 was outstanding!  I was able to roam throughout the house without experiencing and signal degradation or interference.  Frequency response was suburb, and the overall sound was crisp and enjoyable.  It helps that there is no frequency overlap in my house; i.e. my cordless phone operate at 5.8GHz and my wireless LAN operates at 2.4GHz.  The Sennheiser RS-120 operate on a radio frequency of 926MHzWork is a different story altogether.  The Sennheiser RS-120's still work for the most part but there is some interference from my other wireless accessories, including my cordless keyboard and mouse and cordless Plantronics headset.  I am able to change the channel and fine tune the frequency when needed however, and for the most part I am able to listen to music and or radio interference free.The range inside my standard office building setting is outstanding through doors and walls.  I can roam a considerable distance before static degrades the signal; very impressive.ConclusionI like my new Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless Headphones, so much so that I am planning on purchasing a set for my home stereo.  Yes, there is some interference in my work setting with other devices, but I expected that and systems ability to allow for fine tuning is a definite plus.  If you are in need of quality wireless headphones you could do a lot worse than the Sennheiser RS-120.",1290297600

I was playing xbox 360, and took me around 5 minutes to finally get a good enough sound. Forget about amazing stereo sound, it really sounds like an analogic radio at best. And then, I decided to change seats from the couch to the chair, a loud interference noise almost gave me a heart attack.Don't waste your money on this, save a little bit more and get a descent headphone.

You need to turn UP the volume at the amp and turn DOWN the volume on the headphones. But you will not be able to do this trick if you plug the transmitter into the phono output from your amplifier. Often the volume on those outputs is fixed and cannot be controlled. It my just be too low for the use of these headphones.Aside from that, they worked well in terms of range throughout the house.With so many wireless gadgets in our house, other products have often picked up interference, but these headphones worked perfectly.Audio quality is good but not jaw-dropping, especially if you already have very good amplifier and speakers for comparison. The unit is a bit heavy and makes your ears hot and will slip off if you bend over.

"12 22, 2012","[3, 3]",4.0,Nearly perfect solution to apartment living,B0001FTVEK,webhawk50,A2XOS0D485JSMM,"So here's my story: my house burned down in September and I was forced to live in an apartment for the first time in many years.  I had to buy a new TV and sound bar system which immediately got me into trouble with my neighbors, even after I tried cranking the volume way down and moving the subwoofer around.  Here's the thing: I enjoy watching movies but I'm hard of hearing and I like my sound jacked up, so I needed a solution.  Enter the Sennheiser RS120 wirless headphones.  They have proven to be the nearly perfect solution to my problem.  I followed the directions and charged them up for the initial 24 hours and they now work flawlessly.  I am again able to watch my movies at any volume I choose without bothering my neighbors.  The sound quality is very good for what are relatively inexpensive wireless headphones.  I did check out the Sennheiser RS180 headphones at my local Best Buy and the RS180's certainly have a much richer overall sound quality, but at more than $200 more I simply could not justify the price difference.  I can't say that the RS120s are the best there is for the price because that would obviously entail trying out and comparing every wireless headphone on the market, but I can absolutely say that the the RS120s are a fantastic bargain for the price.  But there are some caveats that you need to be aware of.  I've listed a few of the Pros and Cons here:Pros:(1) Decent quality sound; bear in mind these are not $200+ headphones, but they certainly rival many headphones costing much more; I have had no static issues that I'm aware of, but as I said, I am hard of hearing (but primarily in upper range frequencies)(2) Good range--I can walk all over my place and never have any problem losing signal.(3) They just work and work well!(4) Comfortable (but see #1 below)Cons:(1) Tend to slip off of my head if I bend my head too far forward; it's not a huge deal, but they don't really hug my ears as well as I would like; still, they're very comfortable(2) You do have to be careful when you lose signal; you will get some loud static; the solution is to make sure to turn the volume down. Just to be fair: this is going to be a problem inherent in virtually ANY wireless system.  Signal loss goes with the territory.(3)  This is the big one:  the analog connection is for component ONLY. You can either plug it straight into the red/white RCA jacks or use one of the included adapters for various headphone jacks or other ANALOG outputs, but since my TV does not have analog component outputs, the only way I can watch regular TV with these is through an optical coax to analog converter (which will set you back another $40).  I AM able to plug the red/white component jacks into the back of my Blue Ray player with no problem, but I am unable to use them with just straight TV without the converter.  This is really a significant drawback because otherwise, these are really nice headphones.The bottom line here is that in spite of the Cons listed above, I am still very satisfied with the RS120's sound quality, performance and price.  I can highly recommend them to many users.  Just keep in mind some of the caveats listed here, primarily Con #3 above (analog only hookup).",1356134400

I wear hearing aids and the TV placement does not let me enjoy the surround sound produced by many of the stations without increasing the volume to a level too loud for the rest of the family. The headphones fit over the ears without removing the hearing aids and I can experience the surround sound without changing the TV volume. The reception is good enough to let me walk around the house and onto the porch outside without missing any of the dialog. In addition, the quality of the sound is quite good. While wearing the headphones, the open air design allows me to hear when someone in the room speaks to me.",1323734400

I even walked out to my parking space with them and didn't miss a bit of the football game.  I use them for TV but checked them out on my cd (music)player and the sound was very good!!  They are very light....but.... if I walk around with them on, they will slip off pretty easily.  The battery seems to take a long time  to recharge.  That is, it takes a while for the light to turn green.  Many times I'll be using it while still on the red. It works fine, just the same, and has not been a problem.. You also must be careful to make sure the headset is on the charger evenly or it won't charge properly.Finally, they may be German but they are made in China....of course.Bottom line, I am satisfied and would recommend them to friend and foe alike...PS",1232841600

I didn't expect the sound quality too much since I thought headpones can never compete with my floorspeakers which have a deep and tight bass. But the sound of this one is so good that much beyond my expectation: crisp high, sufficient bass...Also the rechargeable batteries last a long time to use.

I purchased this for him on his birthday and its the best gift every says his wife; my father wears this every night and he loves it because now he hears everything and everyone else isn't bothered by his TV viewing.

The headphones do not &#34;hug&#34; your ears and feel pretty cheap.I &#34;used&#34; them once.  Left them plugged in for a few months and just threw them out when they were just cluttering up space.  An item like this is basically &#34;good enough&#34; for general purpose use or isn't.

That was years ago, I was hoping these would be different, but they're not. They have good sound quality but theres a constant buzz/humming noise no matter where I place the base and no matter how I tune the frequency, that is completely unacceptable as I just wanted headphones to have on while in my office so I could just walk around from time to time, lay down on the couch, and still be isolated with my music.I just received the headphones today, tried them out for a couple hours, returning them. I will never try wireless again, the loss in audio quality is just not worth it.",1346716800

I can wander all over the house, even out to get the mail, and the reception is still strong. The battery life is great, too. The controls could be a little easier to use, but once you set the volume where you want it, you'll only use the on/off switch after that, anyway, so it's not a big deal.
