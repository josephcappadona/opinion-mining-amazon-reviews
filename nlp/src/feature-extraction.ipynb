       "   'reviewText': 'We got ours last night and got down to business. Serious home-economics business. The big ones I was worried about were entertainment center with Wii, stereo, etc. \"on idle\", a laptop station in another room that is often left on and then finally I just installed a window A/C unit in our bedroom to avoid paying for all-night whole-house A/C when we are only in one room (childless couple as you may have imagined).Anyhow, the entertainment center turned out to be costing us something like $15...per year. A buck and change a month. Not worth the hassle of fooling with, but I did put the Wii, amp, preamp and various disc players on a single switch on our uber-power supply in order that we can squelch even that.I did some preliminary stuff around the house...lots of stuff like *newer* cell phone chargers draw almost literally nothing. I think it was $1.76 per YEAR *when charging* for our cell phone chargers...a pittance at cents a month. When phones are not plugged in, our chargers drew only LED power...i.e. unregisterable as it was less than one-tenth of a cent an hour.So...mostly just confirmation that a lot of the potential \"vampires\" out there really aren\\'t.BUT...WOW...in some cases, you must be careful...We stuck our Bunn coffeemaker in the thing. The numbers started ratcheting up...fifty dollars per year...seventy...one hundred and twenty...one hundred and fifty... OH MY GOODNESS...The Kill A Watt EZ works on averaging over time, I realized we had *just* turned this thing on and it was going from cold to \"heat water up - QUICK!\" mode...in other words, drawing lots of power. That said, while Bunn coffeemakers I believe make the best tasting coffee and quick, they do the \"quick\" part of that by leaving the water heater on standby mode, always heating the water up as it cools.Naturally, I have always wondered about how much that sucker costs per year. I think I will feed it some water and let it run for a few days to get an averaged yearly cost. Should be interesting and if Amazon lets me I will report back.Secondly, another issue: I plugged this thing into our turned-off Oster blender...this is one of the classic vintage style blenders, if that matters at all...and it was reporting something like $4.75 per month, IDLE. Weird.Then, after a bit, that number started dropping...and dropping...and dropping.Perhaps when it first starts, there is some big surge that runs through it that was taking a while to be diluted by the draw-per-minute averaging in the Kill A Watt EZ.Anyhow, I really think that thing uses nothing when plugged in and idle.*** The important point to the blender example is that there will be a temptation to perform quick-hit analyses on your appliances, but this is not always the best strategy. This thing will give an accurate yearly cost for something that draws consistently, but anything that has a weird spike when first plugging it in or that turns on and off in terms of draw, like a Bunn coffee maker\\'s water heater or a window A/C unit that blows cheap fan constantly, but turns on it\\'s power-consuming compresser here and there must be left on for a while to get that averaging going. That is the only way you\\'ll get an accurate and realistic actual-use cost. ***Microwave was also basically nothing year-long when not in use...I think it was one dollar a year, maybe. It was apparently just powering it\\'s little calculator-style LCD display, and that was it. The power gets sucked during cooking, but how many minutes per day are you doing that?A floor fan costed $11...per year...to run continuously. The way we were using it, it was probably costing us $4.50 a year...and to think I used to get upset if one of us left it on all day. HA!My InFocus projector (800x600 DLP projector) draws 1 cent per hour. Well, wow, that shocked me. I left that on for a while and it still reported 1 cent per hour. Good stuff! I am sure they will come out with LED projectors that use 1 cent per 10 hours, but until that time, I have no good reason to switch or upgrade...power is cheap.(Oh, forgot to mention, power is 12 cents per kWh where I live at the moment...price your own accordingly).Oh, that window A/C unit is - I think  - about 8,000 BTU and  came in at thirty-six cents per night. I am sure our A/C for the house was running at least dollar a night, judging by our bill, so this should save us 60% (36 cents instead of a buck) of about half of our bill (since 8 hrs we use A/C wall unit, 8 hrs we use whole-house and 8 hrs it is OFF completely during the day when we are gone). So 30% savings right off the bat...and that will pay for the A/C wall unit very quickly.In the final analysis, there wasn\\'t much adjustment made. This thing did not really directly pay for itself monetarily, but in terms of peace-of-mind, it definitely helped. I think our major expense is air conditioning, and after two months of our bill jumping over 50%, I am hoping the use of the window unit solves our energy \"crisis.\" I sure couldn\\'t find anything else (plugged in anyways, hardwired is another story) that seemed to draw anywhere near significant amounts of power.The Kill A Watt EZ was worth it for me as a \"peacemaker\" - both with myself and with my wife. The peace-of-mind was easily worth the thirty bananas it costed, and the hour-day-month-week-year calculations are WELL worth the ten or twelve more bones you pay for the \"EZ\" model over the regular P4400...if I had to do it all over again, I\\'d still pick the P4460...well worth the hassle savings. The criticisms about it being hard-to-read and the solution to stick it on an extension cord (I used a power strip, which was perfect as it was short and highly portable versus a big bulky three-prong extension cord) are both spot on.Well done, P3, for a great product. Our \"vampire hunt\" didn\\'t turn up any convincing vampires, but it did ease our minds about them and allowed us to better focus our energy saving...well...energies.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'I have been able to trim my average $224 monthly utility bill to about $125 per month by converting to 100% CF light bulbs, even above bathroom vanities, and in overhead and outdoor spotlighting. I was very happy to see my bill drop by about $25-30 a month on an annual comparison basis. Next, we started unplugging and turning off fans and lights that were not being used and then turning the thermostat up a degree.I added double layer window treatments as well to keep the heat out. Every improvement had paid for itself and sheer curiosity led to the P3 International Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor.I plugged the power strip for my home entertainment center into this after plugging in my local utility rate, and then sat by with bated breathe waiting for the initial estimate. Nothing came through. I found out that this needed to run for at least a couple of days before it would come up with a number. Once I got a number I left it plugged in for a month and then checked again. Overall, I was very pleased. We have a 42\" HDTV, HD-DVD player, xbox 360, stereo receiver with two speakers, Cable box, CD player, and a Squeezebox Duet system. Annually, the total cost is $54. I felt that was very reasonable, and it was nice to have a number. Next I plan to plug it into a lamp, and since all of our lamps are using the same bulb, I will be able to get a very good estimate of their annual (average) cost of operation as well.If you\\'re a big numbers person, or are looking to find ways to reduce your energy cost, this could lead you in the right direction, and it\\'s a fun gadget to have.Cons: screen is not too bright, and if you have it plugged in low behind things, it\\'s hard to get to and read. Solution: buy a power strip liberator.I think that the power companies should rent and/or loan these out to their customers (with a deposit of course). They\\'re always trying to get people to use less energy, and this could be an affordable eye opener.',\n",

The media bridge cables are the best, they feel like they click in when you connect them, very solid. Motorola? Not so much.\",\n",

Some people might find it more comfortable to find one with a longer cord, but good luck finding one for such a good price. The light on this charger is very very bright blue, which I find kind of hurts my eyes when I'm driving in the dark, but that's not a big deal to me.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"I've been bitten many times before buying 3rd party wall and car chargers, usually on the cheap and almost never legit. Plenty just don't work right. But I was very happy to find when I bought my Motorola Droid that there was a real Motorola car charger available for cheap on Amazon, so I was sold. This, my Droid, and theCar Dockmake a very happy trio for navigation in my car.However, there are a few minor concerns I'd like to point out: First, the blue LED. Not only does the end of the charger seem to only take up space and shamelessly promote Motorola, the blue LED creates a bit of a distraction, at least where my cigarette lighter is in my vehicle. I'm thinking of taking it apart and removing the LED, but I don't travel at night too much with it so I might let it slide. Second, I've noticed that sometimes it doesn't actually charge the phone, just keep it powered - but to be fair, this is probably either my Droid or the car, not the fault of the charger itself.I haven't had a chance to try charging any other MicroUSB devices with my charger, but I can only assume it works swimmingly. I would definitely recommend this over anything overpriced Verizon is offering you for your Droid.\",\n",

Most of the time the phone won't synch with the charger, but when I do get that little sound that means it's synching, it won't charge.What a waste - are we expected to just buy a new one of these every few months?  It's a car charger -- it sits in my console, out of sight, barely touched most of the time.  How is it that it just stops working?  I have two other chargers in my house that I just abuse on a regular basis moving them around, coiling them up, changing outlets where I connect them, and I've been getting steady use out of them for nearly two years!

On the trip I had 4g on, GPS on, Power Amp music player open and Carhome app opened. In the first half of the trip I noticed that the phone wasn't charging but it wasn't losing any juice either. It was just enough power to maintain how much battery was in there when I started the trip. With the carhome app the screen doesn't turn off unless you do it yourself. So I turned the screen off and when I got to my destination the battery went from 60 to 85% full in about an hour or so. The first half of the trip I wasn't happy at all with it because I thought it wasn't powerful enough to charge my phone.

Just have a full charge, and I was good to go.But, with the droidx, once you start using the smart phone features, like the GPS (which I use when I leave my regular GPS at home), the battery goes down faster than just used as a phone.And, with the price ($4.71, though it's now $3.15), I figured why not?

       "   'reviewText': \"My old Griffin Powerduo doesn't work well with my new Samsung Epic 4g. Every time the phone recognized the Griffin charger as a PC USB port, so no much current can be provided from the charger. When I used the google navigation, the battery dropped 20% in less than one hour with the phone connected to the Griffin auto charger. The battery dropped about 2% in 10min when I watched a Youtube HD video through 4G network with the phone connected to the Griffin wall charger. Basically, the Griffin Power Duo is almost useless for this phone.Then I found this OEM Motorola auto charger. It says 950mA current, so I decided to give a try. It turns out work great with the Samsung Epic 4G. The phone recognize it as a regular charger. When I use the google navigation, the battery can still get charged even though it's a little bit slower than not using the navigation. I'm very satisfied with this result already.I'm still looking for a decent wall charger to use as a backup for the stock charger and to replace the useless Griffin wall charger.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"I won't be buying those $2 car chargers anymore. I didn't think there was a big difference til the battery in my Samsung Galaxy S2 smart phone stopped holding a charge after only 10 months. I would fully charge the phone overnight and 2-3 hours after unplugging it the phone would die. A tech at my local Sprint store looked at the phone and said the battery showed signs of slight swelling which means it wasn't being charged properly. I knew it had to be my cheap knock-off car charger so I looked for a good one on Amazon and bought this one. I love the Motorola car charger. It doesn't overheat my phone and doesn't fry my phone battery.  The cool blue light on the charger is subtle but very sharp looking. The metal prongs on my old crappy knock-off charger were super tight and barely fit in the charging port. The Motorola prongs are much smoother, very easy to plug in and easy to remove.The old cheap charger I was using would make my phone very very warm (almost hot) when I had it plugged in for over an hour but on several 1-2 hour trips my phone barely even gets warm with the Motorola charger.  The Motorola charges my phone pretty fast without over heating it even when I stream online radio through my car's Bluetooth and use GPS on the phone at the same time. Don't try to save $3-$4 by buying a car charger that could fry your phone's battery or even worse fry your whole phone. Its worth ordering this proven model.\",\n",

It starts with a poor connection at the phone where you have to wiggle it or place it in a certain position to charge and devolves into not being able to charge at all.  Mine is a complete loss and hers is on the way out.  If I just had one and it failed I wouldn\\'t give such a poor rating, but both failing together lets you know there is an inherent flaw in the design.

       "   'reviewText': 'There are so many sketchy sellers selling phone chargers out there, that it can be a bit scary. The problem is that if the charger is poorly made, the output of the charger can be out of spec and can, in some cases, fry the phone you connect to it.For that reason, when it comes to phone chargers, you should stick to name brands. (They are all made in China, but the name brand ones are usually subject to stricter QA).When I found this charger on Amazon, SOLD BY AMAZON, I jumped on it. It\\'s a MICRO USB car charger, made for Motorola and sold under the Motorola name, in retail packaging. The rated output is 4.75-5.25V and 950mA.This charger should work fine with most any phone that uses the MICRO USB connector. The key number to pay attention to is the second one, the rated amperage. This is the MAXIMUM amount of current that the phone can request from the charger. A typical USB port on a PC provides as little as 100mA, and few provide more than 500mA. So this charger should charge your phone faster than when it\\'s connected to a PC. A few phones out now can use up to 1000mA. But that just means they CAN use that amount. If 950mA is provided, they\\'ll still charge, just a bit more slowly.Note that the amperage (second number) merely tells you how much the charger CAN supply, if requested. The phone itself is responsible for asking for the current. That is to say, if this charger can provide 950mA, but your phone can only use 300mA--no problem. Your phone asks for 300mA and the charger provides all of what is requested. If, on the other hand, your phone can use 1000mA, this charger will provide all it can, which is 950mA--a wee bit less than the max asked for. That\\'s also not a problem; it just means your phone will charge a little bit (not much in this case) more slowly. The rated voltage for this charger is presented in a range of 4.75-5.25V. The \"ideal\" voltage for a USB charger of any type if 5V. And most chargers for home use are rated right at 5V. But car chargers work in a noisier environment and thus you have the range. This is where a cheapo charger can really do damage, as some of them are poorly regulated and can provide voltages that are WAY out of spec. Again, when you can get a name brand charger from a seller you can trust (Amazon) for such a reasonable price, it\\'s very foolish to consider the cheapo no-names.This is an excellent quality name brand travel micro USB charger at a price that beats the no-name junk from third party sellers. What\\'s not to like?BE SURE TO ORDER IT FROM AMAZON AND NOT ONE OF THE THIRD PARTY SELLERS, as some of those have been known to make mistakes with respect to what they ship relative to the listing. I can confirm that Amazon is shipping the P513 /89143N charger, as pictured.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'I bought this direct from Amazon (Prime shipping, 2-day was free), and received the charger in OEM packaging (not retail packaging) the next day. (I love Prime!) The inner bag identifies it as a SPN5400A, part #11224-0817337; both numbers are on the charger, though the second is 11224-CC-0817337, and also has CHR-0291 imprinted on it. (Check the image gallery.) The outer bag carried the part #PVN1616, and a barcoded number, 760492-013772, I don\\'t know what those are, stocking codes?As demonstrated in another buyer\\'s video review, the MicroUSB plug has a holographic QA sticker (doesn\\'t have Motorola logo, just a \"check mark\" graphic). The obverse of the plug has the Motorola \"M\" clearly and cleanly molded into it. The plug is molded as one, solid piece. The charger portion is okay, nothing fancy or super-solid, but it holds together. Part numbers are clearly printed on it. It also has a handy little clip on the cord (visible in the first product image) that lets you keep the cord together, either in storage or in use.Pardon the pun, but the proof is in the plug-in. As measured on my HTC Amaze 4G, this charger provides up to 800mA of charging current while plugged into an AC adapter, compared with 400mA from a similar Duracell car charger. In my car, the charger provides slightly less, but still sufficient to charge the phone while Waze is working (which uses the display, GPS receiver, and 4G network for maps). This is what I\\'ve been looking for, as other lesser chargers actually let the phone\\'s battery drain down due to insufficient charging current. A charger that provides ~800mA - 900mA means the difference of an hour or so LESS to completely charge up, compared with a ~300mA - 400mA charger, if the phone is not in use.Because so many buyers of this and other chargers complain of counterfeit or substituted products for what are listed as OEM replacements, I urge you to buy only direct from Amazon. Ensure the transaction is covered by Amazon\\'s usual product return guarantee, so that if you do get a substitution or fake, you can return it for a full refund, without paying for shipping. Until Amazon cracks down on sellers\\' misleading listings, you are really walking into the lion\\'s den slathered with A-1 sauce when you take a chance on a third party seller, just to save a few dollars.',\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'My wife and I recently signed a new 2-year contract with Verizon and got new phones, which as usual means we need all new chargers for our cars. Rather than spend the $30 Verizon wants for their branded chargers, I ordered this charger for under $6. It appears to be of pretty high quality and charges my Motorola Barrage and my wife\\'s Motorola Droid with no problems. There are only two negatives. The body of the unit is fairly long and bulky, sticking much farther out of the dash than the Verizon charger. Also, the futuristic-looking blue illuminated Motorola logo is huge, and at night it is so bright it can be a little distracting. I have found that if I turn the charger 90 degrees to either side, I can no longer see the huge gleaming logo.UPDATE: I just ordered another of these chargers which are of impressive quality for the money. The first one lasted nearly three years and just recently stopped charging my phones. In addition to the phones mentioned above, it has also worked well with our Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX and our Blackberry Bold. Happily for me, my new car allows me to put the charger inside a closed armrest storage area so I am no longer distracted by the gleaming blue \"M.\"',\n",

This plan was not working out so well.I bought this because I have a Motorola phone and wanted to make sure it would be compatible. In reality...I just wanted the glowing blue circle.The charger does work quickly!  I've had no problems charging my Atrix HD. It is a micro USB charger so it also fits my husband's Samsung Galaxy3, my son's Nokia Lumia, and I've used it to charge the Kindle Fire.Works fast. Looks good.  Excellent buy.  I've had it since early August and there have been no issues.  I do keep it in my vehicle and it doesn't get moved around or handled very much. I'm not sure if that makes a difference but wanted to note it now in case there are problems in the future.  It is used at least 5 days per week.\",\n",

I was delighted to come across this one for so cheap (under $6).  I know there's some discussion about whether or not it's a genuine Motorola, but mine does appear genuine to me, by all the hallmarks the other reviewers say to watch for (hologram sticker, buying it with Amazon as the seller, etc.).It works (Droid Razr), and everything is good, though I'll say that I wish the blue light would only light up while it is charging something.  If I leave it plugged into the lighter, it will keep shining after I unplug my phone.  It's not super bright, and it didn't run down my car battery (even when my car sat for several days), but I do worry that some punk walking by will spot the blue light and, not knowing what it is, break into my car just to steal a charger.  The solution there, of course, is just to unplug the dumb thing every time, but we know that's not gonna happen, so, again, I wish the blue went off when the phone is unplugged.But the charger works and it's cheap, so I'm happy!\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"This is an original Motorola charger. It will fit any phone with a Micro USB charging port. (HTC Evo, Droid Incredible, Droid X, etc.)This charger is a high output, rapid charger. It will deliver up to 950mA of power. Most of the newer smart phones can draw 1A of power, so this charger will work perfectly for them. It will show on your phone as an AC power charge. This will charge your phone quickly and easily, even with multiple apps running, including GPS navigation and 4G.If your phone charges at less than 1A, that is still fine. It will NOT overcharge your phone. The charger can deliver UP TO 950mA, which means it will only deliver what is asked of it. If your phone only pulls 500mA, then it will only deliver 500mA.The construction quality is great. It seems solid and well built. I fully expect this to last a long time. It is a very attractive design, with stylish blue lighting. I don't know the exact length, but the cord is longer than most, and supple. It will easily and comfortably reach anywhere on or around the front seat.My girlfriend and I both have this charger, and we've both used them extensively. I can personally attest to its ability to fully charge while using GPS navigation, 4G, and running multiple apps during an extended 7 hour drive across the state. Using both her Incredible, and my Evo.This is a great price for such a quality cable. You should not be paying 20.00 dollars or more from the major phone carriers. Buy this, and you will be more than satisfied in every way. This is a much bette cable than anything the carriers sell.I am completely thrilled with this cable, and will not hesitate to recommend them to anyone, and purchase them as needed for gifts for others.Hope that helps...\",\n",

Plus the temperature rise is only a few degrees indicating good efficiency. Interesting packaging with the Motorola logo lit with a blue led. Might mention the two leads inside the insulated wire (one red, other black) are stranded wire of about 20 guage so I can see how flexing the cable at the connector when attached to a device in an auto might cause an intermittent break.

I knew this was the same micro-USB power Adapter as my Samsung, but everytime I plug this in my phone it seems to open up the accuweather app and plus I have my digital clock on my lock screen set to display on top and it puts it on the bottom of my lock screen. In order to put it back on top I have to turn off the phone and thats what this charger doesn't do. It automatically reboots it instead of turning it off completely. I know that's not a bad thing but I like it to turn off completely. The only cool thing is the blue Motorola emblem lights up in the middle to indicate it's on. Gonna try to find my old charger and buy that when I find it. I'm assuming that the electronics in this charger is geared toward Motorola only.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"I own a Samsung Infuse smartphone and like many other smart phones you cannot use it in the car for GPS purposes without draining the battery.  Even with the standard factory car charger (which is 500 ma), the battery still drains while the phone is being used as a GPS.After doing some research I came across this charger (which supplies 950ma) and from the buzz online it seemed like it would do the trick for me.  Well, it's an improvement over the standard 500ma charger, though not perfect.I find that on full brightness - which is typical of what you'll need for daytime car GPS usage - the battery still drains even when using this charger.  Bummer.  To be fair, the drain is much lower than the standard 500ma charger, and drastically less than using no charger at all, but the battery still slowly drops nonetheless.  If you drop the screen brightness, or turn the screen off for extended highway drives, then the battery drop all but ceases.So that is only a minor drawback.  A bigger drawback for me is that on several occasions my phone has overheated and frozen while using this charger with my phone's GPS fuction.  This required me unplugging the charger and rebooting my phone to remedy.  This is a HUGE pain when you are behind the wheel and driving somewhere you are unfamiliar with.  Keep in mind the standard 500ma charger would have no such overheating problems.  Apparently the engineers at Samsung specified the 500ma current in order to maintain full functionality of the phone under all conditions - even car GPS usage.  Anything over that is not within spec and could cause the phone to overheat under certain circumstances.That said, I am still fairly happy with the charger.  So long as I am not doing anything intensive with the phone in the car, it charges my phone very rapidly with no problems what so ever.  Just be aware of the above caveats and you should be fine.\",\n",

It did seem to charge faster than other auto chargers I have used.  One minor issue is that the blue lighting produced by the charger is somewhat distracting while driving at night. It is bright and can produce glare in the driver\\'s peripheral vision.  This is easily solved by either placing tape over the light source, or just turning it sideways.  The charger worked great hooked up to my Droid X auto mount for over a year, but recently started working only part of the time and needs to be jiggled to get it to work.  You hope when you buy name brand over generic that you\\'re going to get a little better build quality, but at this price I\\'m just viewing it as a \"lease\" and just purchased a replacement.

This charger is significantly faster, at least twice as powerful. This was an expected result as I have always had excellent experiences using Motorola\\'s chargers.I took one star off because the LED is just way too bright out of the box for driving at night. Fortunately, they allowed the \"M\" circular window to be easily removed by popping out the bottom ring (look for a screwdriver indent). After removing the window, the LED is easily accessed, so I applied some white-out to the LED, which successfully lowered the light output to a tolerable level.The cord and connector seem to be high quality. The cord comes with a small hook to keep unwanted extra cord out of the way - a nice added touch.Very pleased with this charger so far overall. I have owned plenty of terrible microusb chargers and this one gets the job done right.',\n",

It's basically sticking an advertisement for Motorola into your car, who wants that?Second, the price you pay, you can easily afford a dual-usb socket, which while meaning you'd have to provide your own USB cables, means you can charge two items at once, and it's not in your way as those sockets are relatively tiny.Third, the item emits a blue light, that illuminates the center plastic piece.

I find that a 1900 mAh battery charges from 0-100% in about an hour and a half. Most of my old/other chargers take a little over two hours. On a daily basis I find that it charges from 50% in about 35-45 mins.',\n",

I'm very happy with this - sometimes I feel like just charging my phones and accessories in the car instead of in the house now.

The plastic window makes the Motorola M glow a subdued blue, but it's not too bright as to be distracting so I don't mind it.Another thing to note, the coiled cord is softer than the Verizon cord but seems to retain it's shape.  This is a plus in my opinion since holding the phone or moving it around with the softer cord puts less stress on the USB jack in the phone.I bought mine directly from Amazon and I actually just ordered a second one, I don't see how you can go wrong with it (as long as you get a real one just like mine).\",\n",

However, the Motorola logo makes the plug needlessly long. If you don't have much clearance where you're going to plug this in, you might want to consider a different brand.Also, the Motorola logo glows blue whether it's connected to a phone or not. If your car doesn't automatically cut power to your outlet when you turn off your car, you could attract thieves.Other than those minor issues (luckily, neither of which impact me), this cord is great. The design is fresh, and the entire thing is built with the quality you'd expect from a company like Motorola. I'm using it to charge myNokia N900, and it works flawlessly.

I\\'ve got 2 and they look really nice, are built well and work great. They definitely put my Verizon, AT&T; and Sprint branded chargers to shame, which have a difficult time charging with the screen on and GPS running. With the P518, I can have the phone blazing with everything imaginable running and it still charges. At a 1 amp charge capacity, it\\'s fast too. Not like \"charge your phone from dead to full in 10 minutes\" fast, but faster than all the others I\\'ve tried.The only downside (if you can even call it a downside) is the blue light is a bit bright at night. Not like staring into the sun bright, but still somewhat bright. I actually love how it looks, so it\\'s of no hindrance to me. Also, it sticks out a bit further than most chargers, so if your lighter receptacle is in a tight place, you may want to consider this.

I've gone through a couple of off-brand chargers that seemed to break after a year of use that cost a few bucks more than this one.  If you are looking for a good charger for your Motorola-branded phone or anything else that charges via a micro-usb like my Kindle Fire, I would recommend this one.3/18/14 Update:The above review was written after using the charger for about two weeks.  After a longer period of time, while my comments on the durability / construction of the charger remain valid, the power output is pretty minimal and I am changing my rating from a 4 star to a 3 star: charging my Motorola phone takes a heck of a long time if the power level is less than 50% and, for example, when it isdown to 20% and plugged in during a two-hour drive, it consistently never gets above 50% charged.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': \"I have a Galaxy Nexus, and my wife has a Samsung Droid Charge phone and we use this as our charger of choice in both of our cars.  I've bought several different type of generic knock off chargers in the past.  Some that did work, but broke easily, and some that were so poorly made that they wouldn't charge my phone at all.  This Motorola made charger does a great job of charging my phone.  Even if I am streaming music via Bluetooth to my car and using my phone as a GPS, the charger is still able to overcome the power drain and keep the battery charging.  If I had to make one nitpick its the bright blue logo that is lit up while its plugged in.  Its not overpoweringly bright, but its unnecessary in my opinion.  Despite this, I still think this is the best value for a cell phone charger out there.  Highly recommended!\",\n",

I still like the feature of the blue light that glows once you plug it in to the 9V lighter port. Would be nice to have an indicator to show full charge/charging mode.

I read the reviews to see if anyone tried it with an S3 and I saw quite a few positive reviews. I bought it for less than $5 and gave it a try. It worked great and charged my phone pretty quickly, even while using GPS and streaming music. I think that this device puts out about 950 mah, which is adequate for most phones. One of the reasons it works so well is because my phone detects it as an AC charger allowing for a better and faster charge. Plus, this device looks nice and lights up blue when plugged in. I would definitely recommend it. I actually just bought a second one because I like it so much.',\n",

It bundles the cord a little and helps to keep it out of the way, not by a lot, but a little, and every little bit helps in a car.

I originally bought an el cheapo cigarette lighter charger online, and it fell apart after 5 months of light use.  This one feels much more sturdy than any I have ever owned.  Also, at night, gives a cool blue effect from the lighted up part.  It's not really bright, so it won't affect your driving/blind you at night.  The cable is very long, so you don't have to worry about it being too short.  Great product.  I recently purchased the Sprint Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works perfectly with it.\",\n",

So I searched on trusty Amazon.I know from past experiences of myself and others...that a bad car phone charger can ruin your phone...so I was hesitant with all the cheap, no name, knock offs.Then I saw this one. A true, blue Motorola brand charger! Plus, at the time of purchase(5/25/11), it was sold and shipped from Amazon. As of today(6/7/11), it is not sold or shipped by Amazon.When I ordered it, it arrived on time, and I tried it right away. It works perfectly. Plus I like the nifty blue logo when it's plugged in. I've seen a couple of reviews saying they received a knock off version when they ordered from the seller I did. Mine was the real thing. It has the Motorola original product sticker...plus you could tell it was well made.I highly recommend this item.\",\n",

So why should you pay top dollar when you know you'll only get enough use out of it until your next upgrade, generally two years at the most? But if you spend a few minutes doing your research, you'll find this car charger for your Droid Incredible. It's perfect! It has the Motorola branding and the price is about one-fifth what you'd pay at the Verizon store or in a Best Buy.It charges your Incredible pretty quickly. I recently was at 2% battery life. I hooked this charger up, went and did my 35 minute workout at the gym. When I returned to my car, the battery was at a 94% charge. Not bad.The Incredible is a great smart phone. But all of you owners also know that it really sucks up the battery, so it's pretty important that you have a car charger readily available. I highly recommend this one. Not only does it do the job very well, the price is right. You will definitely get your money's worth.\",\n",

Easy to remove one end to allow an extended reach.- At first I did not like the underneath cord mount, but it's utility is growing on me. This keeps the cord from getting in the way.- Price: competitive with generic chargers.Cons: the blue light is very bright at night, but it is necessary to be visible during the daytime.

They meet the criteria of low cost, but they usually fail on the important task of working&#34; every time.  This costs $2-$3 more than the cheapo models I've tried, but it works everytime, with every device and continues to work for more than a few months.I've used this in many different cars (some with notoriously troubled cig lighters like my buddy's BMW), and it always seems to work.  I like the &#34;lighted&#34; ring at the end that let's you know in all but the brightest light if it's working.  I also like that it put's out enough power to charge my phone while at the same time using the phone to stream music in my car.  Lastly, I like that it works with all of the devices I've tried it with (Samsung S3, Droid 2, Samsung Mobile Hotspot, and a few friends have charged their devices too).The first one I bought worked so well, I went back and bought a couple more to keep in each of the family cars.  I may need to buy another one or two to keep in my suitcase / computer bag so I'll have one when I travel.  I believe I've had the first one for well over a year and still no problems with any of them.I wish everything was such a good value.\",\n",

The only drawback that I've come across is that bright blue LED that can light up the whole car at night.

I went with this version since the cable is built-in and there could be no mix-ups with what cable to use and where/how to stick it since my MIL is not very tech-savvy. She loves it and it works very well on her phone. The blue LED is not too bright for night-driving yet bright enough to see in daytime so you know it's plugged in. My recommendation would be to get a USB car charger so you can use whatever cable you want and since you have two separate pieces, if one fails, you only have to replace that part, not the whole thing. This however, follows the K.I.S.S. principle and works very well. I would highly recommend.\",\n",

       "   'reviewText': 'Note that I purchased this charger directly from Amazon and not from one of the other shippers. After being pleased with the first one, I tried to purchase 2 more, but Amazon limited me to 1. I purchased the third charger from another shipper, and I worry that it won\\'t be authentic.I received this charger in a baggie containing a statement of Motorola warranty. On the underside of the charger, the input/output electrical specifications were given in Spanish. So I think this product comes from a Spanish Motorola inventory. The electrical specifications clearly state an output current of 950mA at 4.75--5.25V. There is a plastic clip (visible in the picture) on onside of the coil that lets the coil fold in two. That helps keep cable management clean in the car.On my way to work this morning, with my HTC Rezound smartphone initially charged to 90%, I turned on navigation and left the screen on. The sun was out, and so the phone became warm in its windshield mount. Nonetheless, I arrived at work with the phone at 94% and starting to pulse its current draw to reduce incoming current. So the charger did its job nicely.So I am very happy with this charger. For under $6, it\\'s a high-rate charger from a recognizable source.The low price and the fact that Amazon limits the number a single buyer can purchase makes me think that this charger will soon not be available for sale. Get it while you can. Nice unit (if you get the real version from Moto). Hopefully it lasts for a while.SIDE NOTE: If you are looking for a dual-output charger suitable for tablets, I also have recently tried the \"Mediabridge High Output Dual USB Car Charger (3.1 Amp)\" and was pretty pleased with it. I didn\\'t try it with tablets, but it performed the same test as above with the same results (if not better), and so I\\'m pretty confident it really will deliver the 3.1A it promises if necessary (and certainly the 2.1A needed for a single tablet plugged in).',\n",

I don't like this charger.  it charges way too slow to the point that I cannot run my phones GPS on it and keep the current charge, so how can it possibly charge the phone when the phone is in use?  I actually lost battery life while running the phone GPS with the charger plugged in.  Bottom line is that this charger doesn't have enough voltage to charge the phone.  I never had a problem with my previous charger that broke after 2 years.  I tried charging my phone on the way to church (a 30 minute drive)without any apps running and it only increased the battery life by 5%.  for the record I have a Motorola Photon 4g.

I also like the coiled cord, as it means I don't have a long cord hanging around my console. The charger itself feels high quality, so it should last for quite some time. The only drawback I can see is that the charger is a bit longer than I would prefer, but it's not a big deal. All in all it's a solid buy.
