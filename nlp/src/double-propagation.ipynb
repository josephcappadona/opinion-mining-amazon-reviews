      "I bought this camcorder in spite of all the negative reviews i read, because I wanted an external mic input for better sound quality in my videos, and most pocket camcorders have fazed out the external mic option. So this camera is from a couple years back I guess, but I got it brand new in the box, not a refurb, for 80 bucks Shoots in hi-def and widescreen, and the videos come out beautiful, even in regular hi-def mode. There is also an HD+ mode, but you only get half the recording time, about an hour. No kidding, this thing beats my FlipCam 8 ways to Sunday. I did have to spring an extra 25 or so for a tripod, since the VADO is pretty slim and won't stand by itself, but having a tripod only increases my options. It's got a rechargeable battery that will run about an hour and a half, two hours tops. One thing, the price on this thing fluctuates wildly. I got it for 80, when I looked the next day it was a hundred, and the day after that, $120. This from the same vendor. Bottom line, I'm glad I ignored the bad reviews. Most of them were about the battery. I had a battery problem too at first. Thing just would not charge. I read the advice about making sure the battery was installed correctly, but I *knew* that couldn't be the problem. I'm not one of these morons who blows a simple instruction like how to install the battery, and I made specifically sure I was installing it correctly. After a lot of frustration, I finally opened it up, and sure enough, I had put the battery in upside down. After turning it over, no problems since. Buy it for the beautiful HiDef widescreen video. The external mic input is just a plus. Like I said, you can't find them on pocket camcorders, and the next cheapest option with an external mic input will run you at least 300 bucks.\n"

      "I owned the first generation of this camera, so when the lcd broke on the other one after an accident, I was pretty confident that I would love this one as well. Not so.The worst problem is the addition of the touch sensitive controls. It's very easy to accidentally push any of the buttons. I'd read about this in reviews before I got the camera, but it ended up being way worse of a problem than I expected. The only actual button on the back of the camera is the record button, and it must be way too easy to press as well, because in the short time that I owned it I recorded well over 3 hours of footage from my pocket. This even after I turned it off and disabled the quick record option. Call me old fashioned, but I think you should be able to put a \"pocket camera\" in your pocket. Also, I never had this problem with the first generation. Let me also say that I was really disappointed that they cut the amount memory in half from the first generation of this camera, and still without adding the option for a micro-sd slot to add anymore memory. Lastly, it may be a bit superficial, but they changed the wonderful mat finish of the first generation to a glossy finish on this one, and it's covered in fingerprints after only a couple minutes use. Plus, the new design on the front of the camera is just plain ugly.On the plus side, the video quality is pretty good for the price range and given that it's a pocket camera. It definitely captured the colors well and in stunning resolution (though I would love to see them add options for 60fps and better image stabilization). The sound quality is about what you would expect (not so bad), but I love the addition of a microphone jack (for using an external mic instead of the built-in) and I wish I could've tried this out! Also, they added the option to choose your exposure level with this generation, which made me very happy, because the first generation definitely needed it, and so this camera works much better in lower light. Not great, mind you, but better. The added option to to take pictures instead of video was also a nice surprise, and the pictures came out pretty well as long as you could hold the camera relatively still and choose the correct exposure amount.Overall, I was very unhappy with this camera. Mine ended up having some sort of issue, so luckily I was able to send it back and get a full refund; I would not have been happy had I been stuck with this one. I was happy with the video quality, and some of the new options were a step in the right direction, but creative definitely took a number of missteps with this camera that make it almost unusable. The biggest drawbacks of this camera were definitely the addition of touch sensitive buttons and the cameras tendency to record while in your pocket. Creative has definitely fallen behind the pocket camera market, and I do hope they step it up and come out with a camera that can compete a little better. At this point, I'm probably going to be getting the Kodak Zi8 instead.\n"
