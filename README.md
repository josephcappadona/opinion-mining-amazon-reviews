# What is this?
Online shoppers value reviewer opinions, but typically only read a few reviews. Reviews are a one-dimensional rating of a product, which is composed of individual attributes that may be more or less important to each shopper.

We are building a webapp that aggregates Amazon review opinions about a productâ€™s individual attributes to help potential customers make more informed purchasing decisions.

# Goals
1. Build a topical model that determines product attributes that are important to reviewers for each product category.
2. Build a classifier that predicts the sentiment for each product attribute given the reviews for an individual product.
3. Create a webapp that online shoppers can use to obtain product insights drawn from our models.
