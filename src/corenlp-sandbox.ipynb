      "I have been using a Dell Bluetooth notebook mouse for over a year. I elected to try this one because of Microsoft's reputation and because it was on sale.Pros--Comfortable for a small mouse-Responsive movement.Cons--bad battery life - my Dell lasted 2-3 months, this lasts about 2 weeks.-No forward button -my Dell has both forward and backward buttons-No visual indication it's on -the red on other mouse assures you it isn't dead. (though I realize laser's aren't visible-how about another LED???)-No confirmation of connection -other bluetooth items flash the blue light (or something) that let you know it's connected when turned on. It does glow green when you use the power switch to turn it on.-VERY SLOW to connect when dormant. When I first 'wake-up' the mouse after sitting, it can take over 20 seconds to connect. My Dell mouse seldom took over 5 seconds.-scroll wheel center button is too sensitive. I'm always clicking the center button by accident when scrolling and it's annoying.This time last year there were very few choices of a bluetooth mouse for a laptop and all were expensive. There are now more choices and the prices are coming down (a little late in my opinion). I never liked the RF dongle sticking out of my laptop and ending up breaking one before deciding to go bluetooth. My laptop has it built in, so why not use it?If you get a good price on this one and aren't trying to game with it you will be ok. Otherwise wait for the next model.\n",

      "Within 30 minutes of ordering this mouse the money was debited from my account; thats a world record. Amazon confirmed the order via e mail. The Amazon confirmed by e mail that they shipped the item via USPS and provided a tracking number. When I track through Amazon it says \"in transit\". When I track at USPS it says the tracking number produces no results. The I get an e mail saying the item is out of stock. So how can it be \"out of stock\" and \"in transit\" at the same time. Customer service at Amazon tells me they do not charge the credit card if the item has not shipped. So, a couple of week later, my money is gone, I have no mouse, and I cannot get any help from Amazon customer service.Update: I finally re ordered the mouse directly from Amazon. I got the second mouse in a reasonable time frame. It has two problems. It goes through batteries way to fast (try 2 days of lite use) and it constantly looses connection with the computer even when 3\" away. This is the worst mouse I have ever seen.\n",

      "I could not make it connect with Dell Inspiron running Windows 7 x64  - Windows was finding it, installing the drivers, and then it instantly disappeared. Each connection attempt was creating a new device instance in the registry.The culprit was the WiFi adapter. Bluetooth and WiFi a/b/g/n occupy the same 2.4 GHz band and create mutual interference. Some combo WiFi/BlueTooth host chips employ special patterns of frequency hopping to make sure WiFi and BT don't transmit at the same frequency at the same time. This laptop doesn't seem to have that, but there are some settings enabled by default for the WiFi adapter to reduce the interference.I disabled the WiFi in the device manager for pairing the devices. After that, I reenabled it and the mouse was still working. I also set WiFi transmit power to medium, instead of high.EDIT TO ADD: The mouse may stop working occasionally (and then stop working at all). The solution for this problem: open Device Manager, find your BlueTooth adapter, open its properties on Power tab. Uncheck \"Allow Windows to turn off this device to save power\", click OK. If the BT adapter is hanging off internal USB (to see if it is, check View->Show devices by connection), you may want to do the same for the internal USB hub to which the adapter is connected.\n",

Battery life is much shorter on this mouse than my previous USB mouse. I have already replaced the factory supplied batteries. It is also short on features. I apparently didn't read the description very well. I did not realize the only \"extra\" mouse button could not be programmed; it is preset as a \"Back\" button and cannot be changed. On the plus side, the mouse pairs quickly with my computer and it has never dropped the pairing except when I inadvertently hit the Bluetooth off/on key. I have not seen a Microsoft Bluetooth mouse that I like yet. And, I want to stay with a Bluetooth mouse and save my USB ports for other functions. I would not buy this mouse again. I would not recommend it. I bought two at about the same time--the other for my wife. She doesn't like hers either. I will soon replace ours.\n",

      "I've had this mouse for a long time on a Mac.  I keep trying to find a better one, but the rest of them inevitably fail worse than this one at some point.The Pros:The mouse will last forever.The buttons are responsive, and nice and clicky.Tracking is accurate.Stays connected fairly well.It has a pretty decent shape and weight.The Cons:Has a clicky (not smooth scrolling) scroll wheel which feels cheap.Chews through batteries every two weeks.Batteries are difficult to get in  and out.Almost impossible to wake up.So far this is the least sucktacular of any bluetooth mouse I've used on a Mac, which isn't saying much.  I don't know why no one can make a decent bluetooth mouse, but apparently it is impossible.  The above pros are self explanatory so let's get down to brass tacks:This thing eats batteries for lunch and dinner.  Bluetooth mice are known for this, so it is not a surprise, but the worse part is how difficult the batteries are to get in and out.  To get them out you rely on (what appears to be) a nylon tab.  it is too short, thin, and the battery compartment is too small (AAA) to easily remove batteries.  It takes small fingers and a considerable amount of fiddling to get ahold of each tab to pop it's respective battery out.  Then, when replacing the batteries, the tabs get in the way, and the batteries do not positively click into place.  It often takes some massaging to get the battery to make contact.  Again, if the batteries lasted longer than two weeks this would be a minor inconvenience, but as it is, it's a real pain.This mouses worst sin, however is that it is VERY difficult to wake up.  Most bluetooth mice will only take a click or two to wake up.  I could be banging this one on the wall for a solid minute before it will wake up.  It is very frustrating.  It doesn't fall asleep quickly (hence the big appetite for batteries), but when left for ten minutes or so, it will rip van winkle on you, leaving you to click wildly for a solid minute before hurling it across the room in frustration.Other bluetooth mice I have used and given up on:Apple Magic Mouse -bluetooth connectivity on this mouse is fantastic, I just hate it as a mouse.Razer Orochi - this mouse is pretty solid and wakes up easily, unfortunately it's a narcoleptic, and catnaps after only 2 seconds of inactivity which is posatively maddening.Logitech MX 1000(?)  It has been a long time since I had this one so I don't remember what happened.  I think it just broke after a while.  They also don't make it anymore.\n",

      "So I wanted to run some educational software on my Home Theater PC for my kids who are 2 and 3 and get them learning how to mouse around. It is inevitable and imperative a child learns the hand-eye coordination required to perform such complex tasks and at this time in history if kids do not learn to incorporate a computer into their learning they will be behind by the time they enter first grade.The mouse fits well into my three year old daughters hand and she has an easy time guiding the cursor around the screen. This is only day one so I cannot comment on battery life although the pairing was instant and hassle-free. I can mouse precisely about 25 feet away THROUGH A WALL! I cannot emphasise adequately how amazed I am at this feat. Albeit there are fresh batteries in the mouse and that probably will become less amazing as they drain but for now, wow.The mouse will repair with the PC running Win 7 64bit Ultimate in about 2 seconds after I flip the power switch to on and move the mouse around (after the initial pairing of course). I have the tinyIOGear USB 2.1 Bluetooth Micro Adapter GBU421sold on Amazon as well as aBluetooth HID Wireless Keyboard Mouse Control for PC, Mac, iPad, iPhone 4, PDAswhich has a mouse built into top right corner with left and right click buttons on upper left corner which is good for an HTPC, but the mouse is not for little hands trying to work with tux paint and such. I love this combo.I like the back button but wish it had a forward button also (it looks like there is one there but it is just part of the frame. It would have been nice is all).Batteries are easy to install from bottom and cover appears sturdy getting batteries out is another issue. It appears they placed some kind of a plastic flexible tab to help you pull out the batteries, however it is too short to get a grip on to help you get the batteries out unless you have extremely dainty fingers or even those of a child. Even if you keep tension on the tab while inserting the batteries you still need a jeweller's screwdriver or pair of needle nose pliers to grab the tab and lift it. But we will see just how long the battery life lasts.My only other tiny complaint is that the scroll wheel button, like many mice I have owned, tends to require too light of a touch to push the third mouse button. I find trying to scroll and accidentally hitting the speed scroll option instead. I will get used to it though. For me this is only minor.\n",

It has a great battery life which i was worried about from reading the other reviews.. i haven't had to change them yet and it still shows that i have good life left and i have been using it with my laptop every day for the last month in a half or so.. the range is excellent for when i hook my laptop up to my TV.. i cant sit across the room and the mouse still works like a charm. my laptop did not come with bluetooth so i use a usb bluetooth dongle.. i also use bluetooth wireless headphones at the same time as using my mouse, with no interruptions, or issues at all.. plus it all only uses that one usb port! my friend has the apple mighty mouse and he cant say the same about using his bluetooth headphones at the same time as his mouse, he says he has tracking issues, and sometimes makes the sound cut in and out so he only uses one at a time.. boy am i glad i dont have to do that! now i just gotta get a bluetooth keyboard and i will be all set sitting on my couch, using my computer on my big screen. man i love technology. hope this helps people! by the way, it was the cheapest bluetooth mouse i could find at $34 with the super saver shipping.. that is as much or less than a usb mouse..thanks amazon!\n",

      "Here's the pro's of this product:- Light weight and small.  It fits snugly inside of the palm of your hand.- It comes with an off switch, which is a nice feature.  You can turn the mouse off to save battery power.- Comes with a soft carrying case, protecting the mouse during travel.- Works great with a Macbook Pro.  (Sometimes, Microsoft products don't always play well with Apple computers.)The disadvantages:- I have Apple's \"bootcamp\" installed on my Mac, which allows me to run both the Mac OS and Microsoft Windows on the same machine.  It's kind of funny, but the mouse works great with the Mac side, but hates Windows.  After several weeks of frustration, Microsoft Windows one day, all of a sudden, recognized that I had a mouse available to use!  Even though I had been trying to get it to recognize this blue tooth mouse the whole time, it finally figured it out...  ;-)- Both the Mac and Windows side tend to \"temporary\" lose their connection to the mouse once in a while.  This is only temporary until you either click the mouse button, or you move the mouse pointer around on the mouse pad for a couple of seconds (causing the computer to figure out that the bluetooth device is actually trying to communicate with it.)Besides this, I am very happy with this mouse.  The disadvantages aren't huge, nor will they get in the way of being productive, at least on the Mac side.  ;-)\n",

      "When it works, it's a very nice mouse.  However, the battery life is very poor.  I seem to replace batteries about every week or so.  Also, if the mouse isn't used, it disconnects from the PC and then requires about 10-20 seconds to reconnect.  Oddly, for such a short period of down time, this 10-20 second wait is very annoying.  Running Windows Vista (32 bit).  My Apple Bluetooth keyboard, connected to the same PC, does not experience the poor battery life and disconnect issues.\n",

I think it's pretty small and not as comfortable as my full size wireless mouse but this bluetooth mouse links with my laptop's internal bluetooth so i don't have to waste one of 3 usb ports on a mouse connector.

This mouse stands out from others...it's perfect for travel (fewer magazines as mouse pads for me !)5- Smaller than the Logitech M305, which is pretty small, but still comfortableOnly negative so far:A- On/Off switch does seem kind of fragile, not sure how long it will last with travel -- will keep all updated.2011-Aug-10 Update (almost 1 month using it, 8-12 hours per day)Sadly, more negatives:1- The mouse disconnects from the USB Bluetooth device I bought separately VERY frequently -- for GOOD if the machine goes to sleep;2- The mouse is NOT detected by the Bluetooth built-into a Lenovo laptop;3- Batteries only last about 2 weeks with frequent use.** Now looking for another alternative to Bluetooth that will work with a mouse and keyboard -- using only a miniature USB adapter.\n",

      "First, the Bad - this outweighs the good. This mouse is just a little too small, with the buttons in the wrong place. If you perhaps were a small child, this might be a good mouse. My hands are not large, I'm just an average sized guy, but you have to hold this mouse way back to be able to get all the buttons, wheel, and the side button. This leaves half of your hand off the mouse, it's very awkward.Worse is, it's one of those mice where the Scroll Wheel clicks as it scrolls (a good thing!), but the actual scrolling doesn't match well to the clicks - sometimes it will scroll twice for a single position, and sometimes not at all. Overall, it's uncomfortable and somewhat jarring to use because of this. The button presses feel a little mushy on the left button, however the right button is crisp.  Microsoft didn't ship intellipoint with the mouse, and if you go to their site, it's not listed either. The mouse works in both Windows and Mac, but Intellipoint doesn't recognize it as a \"microsoft\" mouse, so you can't assign the buttons. I had to use a third party app to do this. Apparently this mouse hasn't been manufactured in a long time, and wasn't well supported when it was.Now the good - The pointer movement feels right (not too fast, not too slow). I think that's it.I would probably rate this a little higher (3 stars), if I were not a scroll-wheel user. Or maybe a masochist.\n",

Picked up a targus bluetooth usb adaptor. after installing adaptor mouse pairing was fast and easy, it's worked great since. on computer startup there is a little lag time from when desktop loads and the mouse starts to work. it must take a moment on startup to connect. overall shape is good, very comfortable for me. left/right buttons are nice. scroll wheel good also. not much to say. light comfortable and and tracking is accurate even using it on my couch.\n",

      "I've been using this mouse for 4 or 5 months now, and I have to say, it was better than I read in the reviews here.  I use it for the HTPC in my bedroom.  It replaced a Logitech wireless mouse that I was using previously.  The Logitech suffered from an extremely short range, so I decided to use bluetooth for the extended range.The battery life is pretty decent.  It's not much of an obstacle for me, as I use rechargeable batteries, and I always have a fresh set to swap.  However, I usually get about 3 or 4 weeks on a set of batteries (rechargeable rayovacs), and I never even bother to turn it off.  The batteries are kinda tough to change.  I use a set of tweezers to pull the batteries.It tracks well on most surfaces.  In my case, it's only used on a bare nightstand, on my bed sheets, or on my comforter.  It tracks well on all of these.The buttons and wheel all work as they should, and installation on Windows 7 was a breeze.  It also works great on the \"Hackintosh\" side of my PC (so it should be fine for you Mac users).Other reviewers have mentioned that the power switch is easily broken.  I don't know how you could break it unless you're trying to turn it off with a hammer. It seems solid enough to me.The battery indicator doesn't work for me.  The only way I know the batteries are dead is that the mouse stops working.  It does light up when I set it to \"discoverable\" but that's the only time I've ever seen the light.  This doesn't really bother me, but I guess it would be nice to know when it's about to die.The back button (on the left side next to the left click button) may be useful to some, but it's only an annoyance to me.  I haven't picked up on using it to \"go back\" (which it does well).  It bothers me because I always seem to hit it on accident and go back from something that I didn't mean to.  I don't bump it much anymore though.Pros*Great battery life*Long range*Tracks on strange surfaces well*Low cost on Amazon*Never lags*Wakes very quicklyCons*Battery light doesn't work*Back button is a little awkward*Batteries are difficult to change without some kind of toolAll in all, it's a great mouse, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of my bad battery light.I just purchased another of these to use with my other HTPC in the living room.Update:This mouse may be better suited for faster PCs.  It has always worked great on my Gateway (Intel Core 2 Quad, 8Gb RAM, SSD, etc.).  I tried it on an out of the box Acer (AMD dual core 1.6 GHz, 4Gb RAM, much slower than my Gateway), and it lagged A LOT... in fact, it was almost unusable.  I then tried it on a Dell I have (Intel Core i5 3.0 GHz quad core, 8Gb RAM, SSD, etc.) and it works great.  Maybe there's something I'm missing here, but this mouse seems like it works much better on faster PCs.So... you may want to consider another kind of mouse if your PC isn't top notch.  The ones it worked well on both scored 6.0 or better on everything in the Windows Experience Index.\n",

      "I've owned three of these mice.The size is very convenient and pairing was not too difficult.  I find that the mouse has great sensitivity and works on a variety of surfaces.I believe the greatest weakness with this mouse is the on/off switch.The first one I bought, about a week after purchasing, I turned off the mouse.  The button slid over with no problems.  However, when the next time I tried to flip the switch on to use it again, I could not slide it.  The switch was broken.  Since it was rather new and I had my receipt I exchanged it for another one.I use this mouse sparingly and probably haven't touched it in over a year.  With my new job I started using this mouse heavily again. And I experienced the same issue.  Turned off the mouse, it slid over into the off position no problem.  But the next time I tried to use it, I can no longer turn it on.It is quite aggravating since I love the features of this mouse.  I've read over a few of the reviews and I noticed I'm not the only one to have experienced this issue.  If you purchase this mouse, I would give the advice of possibly not turning off the mouse (I believe it goes into sleep mode anyway), or just pull the batteries to save power.  It is really irritating to me, because I really like this mouse.\n",

      "I bought this mouse for my Asus N53JQ - XV1 laptop. It has Bluetooth 2.1+EDR built into it, on Windows 7 Professional x64.This mouse works right out of the gate with Windows 7. You just go to Start>Devices and Printers>Add a Device, and on the mouse, you turn it on and press the (B) icon (Bluetooth icon on the bottom). When it shows up in the 'add a device window', you click it, press next, and wait for about a minute while drivers are fetched, and you are good to go.Just leave Bluetooth on, and next time you switch it on, it'll automatically connect. That's all there is to setting up this mouse.Battery life is okay, it's not as good as Microsoft says (3 months if I recall correctly), but I won some free rechargeable batteries, so it's not that much of a problem to juice them up. I don't use the mouse too often because most times I have classes at my school. It's sometimes easy to forget that it is on, and I don't think it auto-turns off if it's not connected to anything. Mainly because it uses a switch and not a power button. It featurs one LED on the top below the wheel to indicate power(green glow on startup), low power(flashing red), and pairing mode(alternating red/green blinking).The range is pretty nice. Better than my Motorola S9-HD Bluetooth headphones, but that isn't saying much either. I get about the size of an average family room of a house before it becomes hit or miss. That might not sound like much, but unless you are using a JumboTron you probably won't need that kind of range.The construction quality is great. This thing is a engineering masterpiece. It feels great in your hand and zips around on just about anything. It doesn't work on glass (almost no mice do except old school mice), but it works on every surface I use it on. It comes with a little pouch that fits perfectly with it. I love when products come with pouches. One thing about it though, that I miss from my desktop mouse is a forward button. It's easy to hit the back button on the left, but without a forward button you can't go forward again easily. My Logitech MX310 wired mouse has both, and I can't live with mice that don't have those buttons. Granted, forward is not as useful as back, but it's still useful.One thing I DON'T like is that it never asks you for a pin. I'm not sure if it's a 'pinless' connection (if it is, then it's my problem, not the devices), but I have some trouble getting it to work on Linux and my Motorola Atrix 4G(Doesn't support pinless bluetooth yet).Overall, if you don't want one of those dongles from Logitech and the like, then this is for you. I love bluetooth. This mouse is a great example of why.\n",

      "I wanted a wireless Bluetooth mouse to use with my laptop so as to not take up a USB port with a cord or RF adapter. I also needed it to not cost a fortune and to be Mac compatible. This one fit the bill. I like that it has an on/off switch to conserve power and make it more convenient to transport. Most of the time I leave it on my desk and don't actually turn the mouse off, but it's nice to be able to turn it off when I'm going to take it with me. The mouse feels high quality and is comfortable to use. It's not too light, but I actually might have preferred a little more heft. The buttons press without too much pressure but also without feeling flimsy, and the sides are coated in a soft rubber material. There are four buttons--left, right, scroll wheel click, and back. Although Microsoft IntelliPoint isn't obtrusive, I found it unnecessary and uninstalled it. The mouse buttons are all programmable via Expos&eacute;; on the Mac.A few minor drawbacks: The scroll wheel is a bit stiff and notched, and more so in the upward direction than the down. Be aware that this mouse is small. It is definitely meant to be a travel mouse. I would have liked it to be a little bit larger, but the mouse is high enough to actually promote a reasonably good posture. Still, a good wrist-support to use with this mouse is probably a good idea. Of course, the compact dimensions make it more portable.I had looked at theLogitech V470 Bluetooth Cordless Laser Mouseand I might have liked it's slightly larger size and weight, and I do like the fact that it uses AA instead of AAA batteries, but it was substantially more expensive. I ended up going with the Business model of this mouse because it was cheaper and because I prefer the darker color scheme. Unfortunately, I discovered that the Business model does not come with a carry bag. Not a big loss, but worth knowing.I can't speak to battery life yet, as I've only had the mouse for a short time. It comes with regular Duracell AAA batteries. Come time to replace the batteries, I'm thinking I'll get theAmazonBasics AAA NiMH Precharged Rechargeable Batteries (4-Pack, 800 mAh)for it. I'll update if I discover anything worth saying about the battery life.[Update 7/18/12]I still really appreciate many of the positives about this mouse mentioned in my original review, however, regular use has revealed that it is too small both in length and width to provide comfortable long-term use. After using it for work for some time, I found that my fingers, wrist, and forearm were hurting. This is because the mouse is so small (narrow) that my hand ends up bunched up trying to grip it, and it's short enough that my wrist is unsupported. I have medium sized hands and fingers. My wife has smaller hands and has been using a corded Logitech Notebook Mouse, which is much smaller. I'm going to see if she is comfortable with this mouse, otherwise I'll have to return it. For what it's worth, I've rarely turned the mouse off and used it as a primary work device, and so far the batteries are still good.\n",

      "I've been trying to find a BT mouse for a long time that was portable and comfortable so I don't have to use the stupid radio antennas.  I've had several, but they invariably were too small.Pros: The 5000 is almost too small, but actually is pretty comfortable in the hand.  Setup was a little goofy, since I'm use to seeing light on the bottom of the mouse to indicate that it's tracking.  My laptop (Vaio) found and installed it quickly; however, I had to set up in both BT devices and regular devices, since the Vaio only setup in regular devices and it wouldn't work until I setup in BT devices. For some reason the 5000 laser isn't lighting up like other mice, but it still works.  The mouse tracks precisely and well, has 4 buttons, hand sits ergonomically comfortable on it, and so far the laser tracks on all the surfaces I've asked it to do (desk, pad, bed sheet, recliner arm, etc).  I have not seen any lost signal when my laptop goes to sleep, although there is a less than second delay when the mouse power saves, but it is not annoying.  The left and right buttons engage nicely with good tactile feel and click.Cons: The power button on the bottom of the mouse just feels cheap, and initially sliding it on didn't engage all the way.  I tend to have my hand rest forward more on the mouse, so I would prefer the back button on the side to be forward a little; however, this is personal preference since if your hand placement is actually how it should be on the mouse, the button and thumb position is right on.  The biggest annoyance is the track wheel, which is a clicker.  I don't think the clicking accurately scrolls, and would prefer a smooth scrolling wheel.  The scroll wheel as a push button is too easy to push down so the scroll lock engages too easily, which is annoying when I'm only trying to scroll up and down.\n"
